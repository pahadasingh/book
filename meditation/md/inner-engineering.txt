One	man’s	“magic”	is	another	man’s	engineering.

**The	Four-Letter	Word**

Once	it	happened...A	customer	walking	into	Shankaran	Pillai’s	pharmacy	saw	a	man	outside
hugging	a	lamppost,	his	eyeballs	rolling	wildly.

When	he	walked	in,	he	asked,	“Who’s	that	man?	What’s	wrong	with	him?”
Shankaran	Pillai	replied,	unperturbed,	“Oh,	that	guy.	He’s	one	of	my	customers.”
“But	what’s	the	matter	with	him?”
“He	wanted	something	for	a	whooping	cough.	I	gave	him	the	appropriate	medicine.”
“What	did	you	give	him?”
“A	box	of	laxatives.	I	made	him	take	it	right	here.”
“Laxatives	for	a	whooping	cough!	Why	on	earth	would	you	give	him	that?”
“Oh	come	on,	you	saw	him.	You	think	he	dares	to	cough	anymore?”
Shankaran	Pillai’s	box	of	laxatives	is	emblematic	of	the	type	of	solution	being	peddled	all
over	the	world	today	for	those	in	search	of	well-being.	It	is	the	fundamental	reason	the	term
“guru”	has	become	a	four-letter	word.

Unfortunately,	 we	 have	 forgotten	 the	 real	 meaning	 of	 the	 word.	 “Guru”	 literally	 means
“dispeller	of	darkness.”	The	function	of	the	guru,	contrary	to	popular	belief,	is	not	to	teach,
indoctrinate,	or	convert.	The	guru	is	here	to	throw	light	on	dimensions	beyond	your	sensory
perceptions	 and	 your	 psychological	 drama,	 dimensions	 that	 you	 are	 currently	 unable	 to
perceive.	The	guru	is	here,	fundamentally,	to	throw	light	on	the	very	nature	of	your	existence.

There	 are	 many	 spurious	 and	 dangerously	 misleading	 teachings	 in	 vogue	 in	 our	 world
today.	“Be	in	the	moment”	is	one	of	them.	The	assumption	is	that	you	could	be	somewhere
else,	if	you	wanted.	How	is	that	even	possible?	The	present	is	the	only	place	that	you	 _can_ 	be.	If
you	live,	you	live	in	 _this_ 	moment.	If	you	die,	you	die	in	 _this_ 	moment.	This	moment	is	eternity.
How	are	you	going	to	escape	it,	even	if	you	try?

Right	now	your	problem	is	that	you	suffer	what	happened	ten	years	ago	and	you	suffer
what	may	happen	the	day	after	tomorrow.	Both	are	not	living	truths.	They	are	simply	a	play	of
your	 memory	 and	 imagination.	 Does	 this	 mean	 then	 that	 in	 order	 to	 find	 peace	 you	 must
annihilate	your	mind?	Not	at	all.	It	simply	means	you	need	to	take	charge	of	it.	Your	mind
carries	the	enormous	reserves	of	memory	and	the	incredible	possibilities	of	the	imagination
that	are	the	result	of	an	evolutionary	process	of	millions	of	years.	If	you	can	use	it	when	you
want	and	put	it	aside	when	you	don’t,	the	mind	can	be	a	fantastic	tool.	To	shun	the	past	and
neglect	the	future	is	to	trivialize	this	wonderful	faculty.	So	“be	in	the	moment”	becomes	a


crippling	psychological	restriction—it	denies	our	existential	reality.

“Do	only	one	thing	at	a	time”	has	become	another	popular	self-help	slogan.	Why	would
you	do	only	one	thing	when	the	mind	is	a	phenomenal	multidimensional	machine,	capable	of
handling	several	levels	of	activity	all	at	once?	Instead	of	harnessing	and	learning	to	ride	the
mind,	why	would	you	want	to	obliterate	it?	When	you	can	know	the	heady	joy	of	mental
action,	why	would	you	opt	for	a	lobotomy,	for	voluntary	cabbage-hood?

The	 other	 phrase	 that	 has	 hardened	 into	 cliché	 through	 overuse	 is	 “positive	 thinking.”
When	it	is	oversimplified	and	used	as	some	quick-fix	mantra,	positive	thinking	becomes	a
way	of	whitewashing	or	sugarcoating	your	reality.	When	you	are	unable	to	process	real-time
information	 and	 control	 your	 psychological	 drama,	 you	 seize	 on	 “positive	 thinking”	 as	 a
tranquilizer.	Initially,	it	might	seem	to	imbue	your	life	with	new	confidence	and	optimism.	But
it	is	essentially	limited.	In	the	long	term,	if	you	deny	or	amputate	one	part	of	reality,	it	gives
you	a	lopsided	perspective	of	life.

Then	there	is	the	time-honored	business	of	exporting	human	well-being	to	the	heavens	and
claiming	 that	 the	 core	 of	 the	 universe	 is	 love.	 Love	 is	 a	 _human_ possibility.	 If	 you	 need	 a
refresher	course,	you	can	take	lessons	from	your	dog.	He	is	full	of	love!	You	don’t	have	to
go	to	outer	space	to	know	love.	All	these	puerile	philosophies	come	from	the	assumption	that
existence	is	human-centric.	This	single	idea	has	robbed	us	of	all	sense	and	made	us	commit
some	 of	 the	 most	 inhuman	 and	 heinous	 crimes	 throughout	 history.	 These	 continue	 to
perpetuate	themselves	to	this	very	day.

As	a	guru,	I	have	no	doctrine	to	teach,	no	philosophy	to	impart,	no	belief	to	propagate.	And
that	is	because	the	only	solution	for	all	the	ills	that	plague	humanity	is	self-transformation.
Self-transformation	is	not	incremental	self-improvement.	Self-transformation	is	achieved	not
by	morals	or	ethics	or	attitudinal	or	behavioral	changes,	but	by	experiencing	the	limitless
nature	 of	 who	 we	 are.	 Self-transformation	 means	 nothing	 of	 the	 old	 remains.	 It	 is	 a
dimensional	shift	in	the	way	you	perceive	and	experience	life.

Knowing	 this	 is	 yoga.	 One	 who	 embodies	 this	 is	 a	 yogi.	 One	 who	 guides	 you	 in	 this
direction	is	a	guru.

My	aim	in	this	book	is	to	help	make	joy	your	constant	companion.	To	make	that	happen,
this	book	offers	you	not	a	sermon,	but	a	science;	not	a	teaching,	but	a	technology;	not	a
precept,	but	a	path.	It	is	now	time	to	start	exploring	that	science,	working	the	technology,
walking	the	path.

On	this	journey,	the	guru	is	not	the	destination	but	the	road	map.	The	inner	dimension	is
uncharted	terrain.	If	you	are	exploring	terrain	that	is	unfamiliar	to	you,	isn’t	it	better	to	have
signposts?	You	could	find	your	own	way,	but	who	knows,	it	could	take	lifetimes.	When	you’re
on	unfamiliar	terrain,	it’s	just	sensible	to	take	directions.	On	one	level,	that	is	all	a	guru	is—a
live	road	map.	GPS:	Guru	Pathfinding	System!

```
And	 that’s 	why	there	exists	that	infamous	four-letter	word.
Just	to	make	things	doubly	easy	for	you,	I	thought	I’d	make	it	eight...
```

...Sadhguru



**A	Note	to	the	Reader**

There	are	many	ways	to	approach	a	book	of	this	kind.	One	way	would	be	to	plunge	directly
into	practice,	to	take	a	headlong	dive	into	do-it-yourself	mode.	But	then	this	book	doesn’t
claim	to	be	a	self-help	manual.	It	has	a	strong	practical	orientation,	but	there’s	more	to	it	than
that.

Another	way	would	be	to	turn	theoretical.	But	this	book	is	not	an	exercise	in	scholarship
either.	I	have	never	read	any	of	the	yogic	treatises	in	their	entirety.	I	never	had	to.	I	come	from
inner	experience.	It	was	only	late	in	my	life	when	I	skimmed	through	some	of	Patanjali’s	 _Yoga
Sutras,_ 	those	significant	yogic	texts,	that	I	realized	that	I	had	a	certain	access	to	their	inner
core.	This	is	because	I	approach	them	experientially,	rather	than	theoretically.	To	reduce	a
sophisticated	 science,	 like	 yoga,	 to	 mere	 doctrine	 is	 just	 as	 tragic	 as	 turning	 it	 into	 a
cardiovascular	workout.

And	so,	this	book	has	finally	been	divided	into	two	sections.	The	first	maps	the	terrain;	the
second	offers	you	a	way	to	navigate	it.

What	you	are	about	to	read	in	this	section	is	not	a	display	of	academic	expertise.	Instead,
this	section	seeks	to	offer	a	series	of	fundamental	insights—insights	that	lay	the	foundation	or
bedrock	on	which	the	architecture	of	the	more	practice-oriented	second	section	is	built.

These	insights	are	not	tenets	or	teachings.	And	they	are	most	definitely	not	conclusions.
They	are	best	seen	as	signposts	on	a	journey	that	can	be	made	by	no	one	but	you.	They	are
core	perspectives	that	have	emerged	as	a	consequence	of	the	state	of	heightened	awareness
that	has	been	mine	since	a	life-transforming	experience	thirty-three	years	ago.

The	section	begins	on	an	autobiographical	note.	This	is	so	you	know	something	about	the
authorial	company	you	will	be	keeping,	should	you	choose	to	read	the	rest	of	the	book!	The
section	then	unfolds	into	an	examination	of	certain	basic	ideas,	exploring	along	the	way	some
commonly	 used	 (and	 misused)	 terms	 such	 as	 destiny,	 responsibility,	 well-being,	 and	 even
more	fundamentally,	yoga.

One	of	the	chapters	in	this	section	closes	with	a	 _sadhana._ 	The	word	“sadhana”	in	Sanskrit
means	a	device	or	a	tool.	These	tools	for	exploration	offer	a	chance	for	you	as	a	reader	to	put
the	ideas	discussed	in	those	pages	into	action	and	see	if	the	insights	work	for	you.	(These
sadhanas	will	recur	much	more	frequently	in	Section	Two.)

I	 am	 often	 told	 by	 people	 that	 I	 seem	 to	 be	 a	 “modern”	 guru.	 My	 response	 to	 that
observation	 is	 that	 I	 am	 neither	 modern	 nor	 ancient,	 neither	 new	 age	 nor	 old	 age.	 I	 am
contemporary,	 and	 that	 is	 how	 every	 guru	 has	 always	 been.	 Only	 scholars,	 pundits,	 and
theologians	are	capable	of	being	ancient	or	modern.	A	philosophy	or	belief	system	can	be	old
or	new.	But	gurus	are	always	contemporary.

```
A	guru,	as	I	said	earlier,	is	someone	who	dispels	darkness,	someone	who	opens	the	door
```

for	you.	 If	 I	 promise	 to	 open	 a	 door	for	 you	 tomorrow	 or	 I	 opened	 it	 for	 someone	 else
yesterday,	it	is	of	no	relevance.	Only	if	I	open	a	door	for	you	today	is	it	of	some	value.

So,	the	truth	is	timeless,	but	the	technology	and	the	language	are	 _always_ 	contemporary.	If
they	 weren’t,	 they	 would	 deserve	 to	 be	 discarded.	 No	 tradition,	 however	 time-honored,
deserves	to	live	on	as	anything	more	than	a	museum	piece	if	it	has	outlived	its	relevance.	So,
while	I	will	be	exploring	an	ancient	technology	in	this	book,	it	is	also	a	technology	that	is
flawlessly	state-of-the-art.

Personally,	I	am	not	interested	in	offering	anything	new.	I	am	only	interested	in	what	is	true.
But	I	hope	that	the	following	section	will	offer	you	some	moments	when	the	two	converge.
For	at	those	junctures	when	the	conditions	are	right—when	an	insight	is	articulated	from	a
place	of	inner	clarity	and	when	it	meets	a	reader	at	the	right	moment	of	receptivity,	an	age-old
truth	 turns	 explosively	 alchemical.	 All	 of	 a	 sudden,	 it	 is	 fresh,	 alive,	 radiantly	 new,	 as	 if
uttered	and	heard	for	the	very	first	time	in	history.


```
Then	I	was	a	man
I	only	went	up	the	Hill
As	I	had	time	to	kill
But	kill	I	did	all	that	was
Me	and	Mine
```
```
With	Me	and	Mine	gone
Lost	all	my	will	and	skill
Here	I	am,	an	empty	vessel
Enslaved	to	the	Divine	Will
and	infinite	skill
```
In	the	city	of	Mysore,	there	is	a	tradition.	If	you	have	something	to	do,	you	go	up	Chamundi
Hill.	And	if	you	have	nothing	to	do,	you	go	up	Chamundi	Hill.	If	you	fall	in	love,	you	go	up
Chamundi	Hill.	And	if	you	fall	out	of	love,	you	 _have_ 	to	go	up	Chamundi	Hill.

One	afternoon,	I	had	nothing	to	do,	and	I	had	recently	fallen	out	of	love,	so	I	went	up
Chamundi	Hill.

I	parked	my	motorcycle	and	sat	on	an	outcrop	of	rock	about	two-thirds	of	the	way	uphill.
This	was	my	“contemplation	rock.”	It	had	been	for	some	time	now.	A	purple	berry	tree	and	a
stunted	 banyan	 had	 put	 down	 tenacious	 roots	 into	 a	 deep	 fissure	 in	 the	 rock	 surface.	 A
panoramic	view	of	the	city	unfolded	before	me.

Until	that	moment,	in	my	experience,	my	body	and	mind	was	“me”	and	the	world	was	“out
there.”	But	suddenly	I	did	not	know	what	was	me	and	what	was	not	me.	My	eyes	were	still
open.	But	the	air	that	I	was	breathing,	the	rock	on	which	I	was	sitting,	the	very	atmosphere
around,	everything	had	become	me.	I	was	everything	that	was.	I	was	conscious,	but	I	had	lost
my	senses.	The	discriminatory	nature	of	the	senses	simply	did	not	exist	anymore.	The	more	I
say,	the	crazier	it	will	sound	because	what	was	happening	was	indescribable.	What	was	me
was	literally	 _everywhere_ .	Everything	was	exploding	beyond	defined	boundaries;	everything
was	exploding	into	everything	else.	It	was	a	dimensionless	unity	of	absolute	perfection.

```
My	life	is	just	that	moment,	gracefully	enduring.
```

When	I	returned	to	my	normal	senses,	it	felt	as	if	just	ten	minutes	had	elapsed.	But	a	glance
at	my	watch	told	me	that	it	was	seven	thirty	in	the	evening!	Four	and	a	half	hours	had	passed.
My	 eyes	 were	 open,	 the	 sun	 had	 set,	 and	 it	 was	 dark.	 I	 was	 fully	 aware,	 but	 what	 I	 had
considered	to	be	myself	until	that	moment	had	completely	disappeared.

I	have	never	been	the	teary	kind.	And	yet,	here	I	was,	at	the	age	of	twenty-five,	on	a	rock	on
Chamundi	Hill,	so	ecstatically	crazy	that	the	tears	were	flowing	and	my	entire	shirt	was	wet!

Being	peaceful	and	happy	had	never	been	an	issue	for	me.	I	had	lived	my	life	the	way	I
wanted.	I	had	grown	up	in	the	sixties,	the	era	of	the	Beatles	and	blue	jeans,	read	my	share	of
European	philosophy	and	literature—Dostoyevsky,	Camus,	Kafka,	and	the	like.	But	here	I	was
exploding	 into	 a	 completely	 different	 dimension	 of	 existence	 of	 which	 I	 knew	 nothing,
drenched	in	a	completely	new	feeling—an	exuberance,	a	blissfulness—that	I	had	never	known
or	imagined	possible.	When	I	applied	my	skeptical	mind	to	this,	the	only	thing	my	mind	could
tell	me	was	that	maybe	I	was	going	off	my	rocker!	Still,	it	was	so	beautiful	that	I	knew	that	I
didn’t	want	to	lose	it.

I	have	never	quite	been	able	to	describe	what	happened	that	afternoon.	Perhaps	the	best	way
to	put	it	is	that	I	went	up	and	didn’t	come	down.	I	never	have.

I	was	born	in	Mysore,	a	pretty	princely	town	in	southern	India,	an	erstwhile	capital,	known	for
its	 palaces	 and	 gardens.	 My	 father	 was	 a	 physician,	 my	 mother	 a	 homemaker.	 I	 was	 the
youngest	of	four	siblings.

School	 bored	 me.	 I	 found	 sitting	 through	 class	 impossible	 because	 I	 could	 see	 that	 the
teachers	were	talking	about	something	that	did	not	mean	anything	to	their	lives.	Every	day,	as
a	four-year-old,	I	instructed	my	housekeeper,	who	accompanied	me	to	school	in	the	morning,
to	drop	me	off	at	the	gates	and	not	enter	the	building.	As	soon	as	she	left,	I	would	dart	to	the
nearby	canyon,	which	exploded	with	an	incredible	variety	of	life.	I	started	accumulating	a	vast
personal	zoo	of	insects,	tadpoles,	and	snakes	in	bottles	obtained	from	my	father’s	medicine
cabinet.	After	a	few	months,	when	my	parents	discovered	that	I	hadn’t	been	attending	school,
however,	they	seemed	singularly	unimpressed	by	my	biological	explorations.	My	expeditions
to	the	canyon	were	dismissed	as	messing	about	in	a	rainwater	drain.	Thwarted,	as	I	often	was,
by	 what	 I	 regarded	 as	 a	 dull	 and	 unimaginative	 adult	 world,	 I	 simply	 turned	 my	 attention
elsewhere	and	found	something	else	to	do.

In	later	years,	I	preferred	to	spend	my	days	roaming	the	forest,	catching	snakes,	fishing,
trekking,	and	climbing	trees.	I	would	often	climb	to	the	topmost	branch	of	a	big	tree,	with	my
lunch	box	and	water	bottle.	The	swaying	motion	of	the	branches	would	transport	me	to	a
trancelike	state,	where	I	was	asleep	but	wide	awake	at	the	same	time.	I	would	lose	all	sense	of
time	on	this	tree.	I	would	be	perched	there	from	nine	o’clock	in	the	morning	to	four	thirty	in
the	evening	when	the	bell	rang	and	school	was	done.	Much	later,	I	realized	that	unknowingly	I
was	becoming	meditative	at	this	stage	in	my	life.	Later,	when	I	first	instructed	people	into


meditations,	it	was	always	swaying	meditations.	Of	course,	I	hadn’t	even	heard	of	the	word
“meditation”	at	this	point.	I	simply	liked	the	way	the	tree	swayed	me	into	a	state	beyond	sleep
and	wakefulness.

I	found	the	classroom	dull	but	I	was	interested	in	everything	else—the	way	the	world	is
made,	the	physical	terrain	of	the	land,	the	way	people	live.	I	used	to	take	my	bicycle	along	the
mud	roads	in	the	countryside,	riding	a	minimum	of	thirty-five	kilometers	a	day.	By	the	time	I
came	home,	I’d	be	caked	with	layers	of	mud	and	dust.	I	particularly	enjoyed	making	mental
maps	of	the	terrain	I’d	traveled.	I	could	just	close	my	eyes	when	I	was	alone	and	re-draw	the
entire	landscape	that	I’d	seen	that	afternoon—every	single	rock,	every	outcrop,	every	single
tree.	I	was	fascinated	by	the	different	seasons,	the	way	the	land	changes	when	it	is	ploughed,
when	the	crops	start	germinating.	That	is	what	drew	me	to	the	work	of	Thomas	Hardy:	his
descriptions	of	the	English	landscape	which	go	on	for	pages	on	end.	I	was	doing	the	same	in
my	head	with	the	world	around	me.	Even	today	it	is	like	a	video	in	my	head.	If	I	want	I	can
replay	the	whole	thing,	those	years	and	years	of	all	that	I	observed,	with	vivid	clarity.

I	was	a	diehard	skeptic.	Even	at	the	age	of	five,	when	my	family	went	to	the	temple,	I	had
questions—lots	of	them.	Who	is	God?	Where	is	He?	Up	there?	Where	is	up?	A	couple	of
years	later,	I	had	even	more	questions.	In	school,	they	said	the	planet	was	round.	But	if	the
planet	was	round,	how	did	one	know	which	way	was	up?	No	one	ever	managed	to	answer
these	questions,	so	I	never	entered	the	temple.	This	meant	they	were	compelled	to	leave	me	in
the	custody	of	the	footwear	attendant	outside.	The	attendant	held	me	by	the	arm	in	a	viselike
grip,	 pulling	 and	 tugging	 me	 around	 with	 him	 as	 he	 did	 his	 business.	 He	 knew	 that	 if	 he
looked	 the	 other	 way	 I’d	 be	 gone!	 Later	 in	 my	 life,	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 noticing	 that	 people
coming	out	of	restaurants	always	had	more	joyful	faces	than	those	coming	out	of	temples.
That	intrigued	me.

And	yet,	while	I	was	a	skeptic,	I	never	identified	with	that	label	either.	I	had	lots	of	questions
about	everything,	but	never	felt	the	need	to	draw	any	conclusions.	I	realized	very	early	that	I
knew	nothing	about	anything.	That	meant	I	ended	up	paying	enormous	attention	to	everything
around	me.	If	someone	gave	me	a	glass	of	water,	I	stared	at	it	endlessly.	If	I	picked	up	a	leaf,	I
stared	at	it	endlessly	too.	I	stared	at	the	darkness	all	night.	If	I	looked	at	a	pebble,	the	image
would	rotate	interminably	in	my	mind,	so	I	would	know	its	every	grain,	its	every	angle.

I	 also	 saw	 that	 language	 was	 no	 more	 than	 a	 conspiracy	 devised	 by	 human	 beings.	 If
someone	spoke,	I	realized	they	were	only	making	sounds,	and	I	was	making	up	the	meanings.
So,	I	stopped	making	up	meanings	and	the	sounds	became	very	amusing.	I	could	see	patterns
spewing	out	of	their	mouths.	If	I	kept	staring,	the	person	would	just	disintegrate	and	turn	into
a	blob	of	energy.	Then	all	that	was	left	was	patterns!

In	this	state	of	absolute	borderless	ignorance,	just	about	anything	could	hold	my	attention.
My	dear	father,	being	a	physician,	began	to	think	I	needed	psychiatric	evaluation.	In	his	words,
“This	boy	is	staring	unblinkingly	at	something	all	the	time.	He’s	lost	it!”	It	has	always	seemed
to	me	odd	that	the	world	does	not	realize	the	immensity	of	a	state	of	“I	do	not	know.”	Those
who	destroy	that	state	with	beliefs	and	assumptions	completely	miss	an	enormous	possibility
—the	 possibility	 of	 knowing.	 They	 forget	 that	 “I	 do	 not	 know”	 is	 the	 doorway—the	 _only_


doorway—to	seeking	and	knowing.

My	mother	instructed	me	to	pay	attention	to	my	teachers.	And	I	did.	I	paid	them	the	kind	of
attention	they	would	never	have	received	anywhere	else!	I	had	no	idea	what	they	were	saying,
but	on	those	occasions	when	I	attended	class,	I	stared	at	them,	unwavering	and	intense.	For
some	reason,	they	did	not	find	this	trait	particularly	endearing.	One	particular	teacher	did
everything	possible	to	elicit	a	response	from	me.	But	when	I	remained	silent	and	taciturn,	he
seized	me	by	the	shoulder	and	shook	me	violently.	“Either	you’re	the	divine	or	the	devil,”	he
declared.	He	added,	“And	I	think	you’re	the	latter!”

I	was	not	particularly	insulted.	Until	that	moment,	I	had	approached	everything	around	me
—from	a	grain	of	sand	to	the	universe—with	a	sense	of	wonder.	But	there	had	always	been
one	certainty	in	this	complex	web	of	questions	and	that	was	“me.”	But	my	teacher’s	outburst
triggered	another	line	of	inquiry.	Who	was	I?	Human,	divine,	devil,	what?	I	tried	to	stare	at
myself	to	find	out.	It	didn’t	work.	So,	I	closed	my	eyes	and	tried	to	find	out.	Minutes	turned	to
hours,	and	I	continued	to	sit,	eyes	closed.

When	 my	 eyes	 were	 open,	 everything	 intrigued	 me—an	 ant,	 a	 leaf,	 clouds,	 flowers,
darkness,	just	about	anything.	But	to	my	amazement,	I	found	that	with	my	eyes	closed,	there
was	even	more	that	grabbed	my	attention—the	way	the	body	pulses,	the	way	different	organs
function,	the	various	channels	along	which	one’s	inner	energy	moves,	the	manner	in	which
the	anatomy	is	aligned,	the	fact	that	boundaries	are	limited	to	the	external	world.	This	exercise
opened	 up	 the	 entire	 mechanics	 of	 being	 human	 before	 me.	 Instead	 of	 leading	 me	 to	 a
simplistic	answer	that	I	was	“this”	or	“that,”	it	gradually	brought	me	to	a	realization	that,	if	I
were	 willing,	 I	 could	 be	 everything.	 It	 wasn’t	 about	 arriving	 at	 any	 conclusions.	 Even	 the
certainty	of	“me”	collapsed	as	a	deeper	sense	of	what	it	is	to	be	a	human	being	started	opening
up.	From	knowing	myself	as	an	autonomous	person,	this	exercise	melted	me	down.	I	became
a	nebulous	being.

Despite	 all	 my	 wild	 ways,	 the	 one	 thing	 I	 did	 manage	 to	 do	 in	 a	 strangely	 disciplined
fashion	was	my	practice	of	yoga.	It	started	one	summer	vacation	when	I	was	twelve.	A	whole
bunch	of	us	cousins	met	every	year	in	my	grandfather’s	ancestral	home.	In	the	backyard	there
stood	an	old	well,	over	150	feet	deep.	While	the	girls	played	hide-and-seek,	the	regular	game
played	by	us	boys	was	to	jump	into	the	well	and	then	climb	up	again.	Both	jumping	down	and
climbing	up	were	a	challenge.	If	you	didn’t	do	it	properly,	your	brains	could	become	a	smear
on	the	wall.	While	you	were	climbing	up,	there	were	no	steps;	you	simply	had	to	clutch	at	the
rock	surface	and	claw	yourself	up.	Your	fingernails	often	bled	out	of	sheer	pressure.	Just	a
few	of	the	boys	could	do	this.	I	was	one	of	them	and	I	was	pretty	good	at	it.

One	day	a	man	of	over	seventy	years	of	age	appeared.	He	watched	us	for	a	while.	Without	a
word,	he	jumped	into	the	well.	We	thought	he	was	finished.	But	he	climbed	out	quicker	than
me.	I	cast	aside	my	pride	and	asked	him	just	one	question:	How?	“Come,	learn	yoga,”	said	the
old	man.

I	followed	him	like	a	puppy.	And	that’s	how	I	became	a	student	of	Malladihalli	Swami	(as
this	old	man	was	known)	and	got	into	yoga.	In	the	past,	waking	me	up	every	morning	was	a
family	project.	My	family	would	try	to	make	me	sit	up	in	bed;	I	would	keel	over	and	fall


asleep	again.	My	mother	would	hand	me	my	toothbrush;	I	would	stick	it	into	my	mouth	and
fall	asleep.	In	desperation,	she	would	push	me	into	the	bathroom;	I	would	promptly	fall	asleep
again.	But	three	months	after	starting	yoga,	my	body	started	coming	awake	at	three	forty
every	 morning,	 without	 any	 external	 prompting,	 as	 it	 does	 even	 today.	 After	 I	 woke,	 my
practices	would	simply	happen,	no	matter	where	I	was	and	in	what	situation,	without	a	single
day’s	 break.	 This	 simple	 yoga—called	 _angamardana_ (a	 system	 of	 physical	 yoga	 that
strengthens	sinews	and	limbs)—definitely	set	me	apart	in	any	group	of	people,	physically	and
mentally.	But	that’s	about	all.	Or	so	I	believed.

In	time,	I	lost	all	faith	in	structured	education.	It	wasn’t	cynicism.	I	had	enough	zest	and	life
in	me	to	keep	me	involved	in	everything.	But	my	dominant	quality	even	at	this	age	was	clarity.
I	was	not	actively	looking	for	inconsistencies	or	loopholes	in	anything	I	was	taught.	I	just	saw
them.	I	have	never	looked	for	anything	in	my	life.	I	just	look.	And	that	is	what	I	am	trying	to
teach	people	now:	if	you	really	want	to	know	spirituality,	don’t	look	 _for_ anything.	 People
think	spirituality	is	about	looking	for	God	or	truth	or	the	ultimate.	The	problem	is	you	have
already	defined	what	you	are	looking	for.	It	is	not	the	object	of	your	search	that	is	important;
it	is	the	faculty	of	looking.	The	ability	to	simply	look	without	motive	is	missing	in	the	world
today.	 Everybody	 is	 a	 psychological	 creature,	 wanting	 to	 assign	 meaning	 to	 everything.
Seeking	is	not	about	looking	for	something.	It	is	about	enhancing	your	perception,	your	very
faculty	of	seeing.

After	high	school,	I	embarked	on	a	self-study	program	at	the	Mysore	University	Library.	I
was	the	first	person	there	in	the	morning	at	nine	and	the	last	to	be	shooed	out	at	eight	thirty	at
night.	Between	breakfast	and	dinner,	my	only	sustenance	was	books.	Although	I	was	always
ravenous,	I	skipped	lunch	for	a	whole	year.	I	read	widely,	from	Homer	to	 _Popular	Mechanics,_
Kafka	 to	 Kalidasa,	 Dante	 to	 Dennis	 the	 Menace.	 I	 emerged	 from	 that	 one	 year	 more
knowledgeable,	but	with	more	questions	than	ever	before.

My	mother’s	tears	compelled	me	to	enroll	grudgingly	in	Mysore	University	as	a	student	of
English	literature.	But	I	continued	to	carry	the	cloud	of	a	billion	questions,	like	a	dark	halo
around	me,	all	the	time.	Neither	the	library	nor	my	professors	could	dispel	it.	Once	again	I
spent	 most	 of	 my	 time	 outside	 the	 classroom	 rather	 than	 in	 it.	 I	 found	 that	 all	 that	 was
happening	 in	 class	 was	 the	 dictation	 of	 notes,	 and	 I	 was	 definitely	 not	 planning	 to	 be	 a
stenographer!	I	once	asked	a	lecturer	to	give	me	her	notes	so	I	could	photocopy	them;	it
would	save	her	the	trouble	of	dictation	and	me	the	trouble	of	attending.	Finally,	I	made	a	deal
with	all	the	teachers	(who	were	more	than	happy	not	to	have	me	in	class).	On	each	day	of	the
month,	they	would	mark	me	present	in	class.	On	the	last	day	of	the	month	the	attendance	was
registered.	That	day	I	would	enter	and	just	make	sure	they	were	keeping	up	their	end	of	the
bargain!

A	group	of	us	started	meeting	under	a	huge	banyan	tree	on	the	campus	grounds.	Someone
named	it	the	Banyan	Tree	Club	and	the	label	stuck.	The	club	had	a	motto:	“We	do	it	for	the	fun
of	it.”	We	would	assemble	under	the	tree	on	our	motorcycles,	and	talk	for	hours	on	a	variety
of	subjects—from	how	to	make	Jawa	motorcycles	go	faster	than	they	did	to	how	to	make	the
world	a	better	place.	Of	course,	we	would	never	get	off	our	motorcycles	at	any	point.	That
would	have	been	sacrilege!


By	the	time	I	was	done	with	university,	I	had	ridden	all	over	the	country.	Initially,	I	traveled
South	India	on	my	bicycle.	Later	I	crisscrossed	the	entire	country	on	my	motorcycle.	Then	it
was	natural	to	cross	the	national	borders.	But	when	I	reached	the	India-Nepal	frontier,	I	was
told	 that	 my	 motorcycle	 registration	 and	 driving	 license	 weren’t	 enough.	 I	 needed	 more
papers.	After	that,	it	became	my	dream	to	somehow	earn	enough	money	to	travel	the	world	on
my	 motorcycle.	 It	 wasn’t	 just	 wanderlust.	 The	 truth	 is	 I	 was	 restless.	 I	 wanted	 to	 _know_
something.	I	didn’t	know	what	and	I	didn’t	know	where	I	needed	to	go	to	get	it.	But	in	my
innermost	being,	I	knew	I	wanted	more.

I	never	considered	myself	particularly	impulsive;	I	was	just	life-oriented.	I	measured	the
consequences	 of	 my	 actions;	 it	 is	 just	 that	 the	 more	 dangerous	 they	 were,	 the	 more	 they
attracted	me.	Someone	once	told	me	my	guardian	angel	must	be	very	good	and	perpetually
working	overtime!	There	was	always	in	me	a	longing	to	test	the	border,	to	cross	the	edge.
_What_ 	and	 _why_ 	were	never	questions	for	me.	 _How_ 	was	the	only	question.	When	I	look	back
now,	I	realize	that	I	never	thought	about	what	I	wanted	to	become	in	life.	I	only	thought	about
how	I	wanted	to	live	my	life.	And	I	knew	that	the	“how”	could	only	be	determined	within	me
and	by	me.

There	was	a	big	boom	in	poultry	farming	at	the	time.	I	wanted	to	make	some	money	to
finance	my	desire	for	unrestrained,	purposeless	travel.	So	I	got	into	it.	My	father	said,	“What
am	I	going	to	tell	people?	That	my	son	is	rearing	chickens?”	But	I	built	my	poultry	farm	and	I
built	it	single-handedly,	from	scratch.	The	business	took	off.	The	profits	started	rolling	in.	I
devoted	four	hours	every	morning	to	the	business.	The	rest	of	the	day	was	spent	reading	and
writing	poetry,	swimming	in	the	well,	meditating,	daydreaming	on	a	huge	banyan	tree.

Success	made	me	adventurous.	My	father	was	always	lamenting	that	everyone	else’s	sons
had	 become	 engineers,	 industrialists,	 joined	 the	 civil	 service,	 or	 gone	 to	 America.	 And
everywhere	everyone	I	met—my	friends,	relatives,	my	old	school	and	college	teachers—said,
“Oh,	we	thought	you’d	make	something	of	your	life,	but	you	are	just	wasting	it.”

I	 took	 on	 the	 challenge.	 In	 partnership	 with	 a	 civil	 engineer	 friend,	 I	 entered	 the
construction	business.	In	five	years,	we	became	a	major	construction	company,	among	the
leading	private	contractors	in	Mysore.	My	father	was	incredulous	and	delighted.

I	 was	 exuberant	 and	 sure-footed,	 adrenaline-charged	 and	 itching	 for	 a	 challenge.	 When
everything	you	do	is	a	success,	you	tend	to	start	believing	that	the	planets	revolve	around	you,
not	the	sun!

And	that	was	the	kind	of	young	man	I	was	that	fateful	afternoon	of	September	1982	when	I
decided	to	get	on	my	Czech	motorcycle	and	ride	up	Chamundi	Hill.

```
I	had	no	clue	then	that	my	life	would	never	be	the	same	again.
```
Later,	when	I	tried	to	talk	to	my	friends	about	what	had	happened	that	day	up	on	the	mountain,
all	they	could	ask	was,	“Did	you	drink	something?	Did	you	pop	something?”	They	were	even


more	clueless	than	I	was	of	this	new	dimension	that	had	suddenly	exploded	into	my	life.

Even	before	I	had	begun	to	process	what	it	meant,	the	experience	returned.	It	was	a	week
later.	I	was	sitting	at	the	dinner	table	with	my	family.	I	thought	it	lasted	two	minutes	but	it	was
seven	hours.	I	was	sitting	right	there,	fully	aware,	except	that	the	“me”	I	knew	as	myself	was
not	there	anymore;	everything	else	was.	And	time	flipped.

I	remember	various	members	of	my	family	tapping	me	on	the	shoulder,	asking	me	what
happened,	urging	me	to	eat	my	meal.	I	simply	raised	my	hand	and	asked	them	to	leave.	They
were	accustomed	to	my	strange	ways	by	then.	They	left	me	alone.	It	was	almost	four	fifteen	in
the	morning	when	I	returned	to	my	“normal”	senses.

The	experience	began	to	happen	more	frequently.	When	it	occurred,	I	neither	ate	nor	slept
for	hours	on	end.	I	simply	sat	rooted	to	a	single	spot.	On	one	occasion,	the	experience	lasted
for	 up	 to	 thirteen	 days.	 I	 happened	 to	 be	 in	 a	 village	 when	 it	 began—this	 state	 of
overwhelming	and	indescribable	stillness	and	ecstasy.	The	villagers	gathered	around	me	and
started	whispering	to	each	other,	“Oh,	he	must	be	in	 _samadhi_ ”	(a	blissful	state	of	being	beyond
the	body,	well-documented	in	Indian	spiritual	traditions).	India,	being	the	country	it	is,	there
was	a	traditional	understanding	of	spirituality	to	which	they	were	heir	that	I,	with	my	blue
denim–wrapped	brain,	had	no	clue	about.	When	I	emerged	from	that	state,	someone	wanted	to
put	a	garland	around	me.	Another	wanted	to	touch	my	feet.	It	was	crazy;	I	could	not	believe
anyone	would	want	to	do	this	to	me.

On	another	day,	I	was	having	lunch.	I	put	a	morsel	of	food	in	my	mouth,	and	suddenly,	it
exploded.	 At	 that	 moment,	 I	 was	 able	 to	 experience	 the	 miraculous	 alchemy	 of	 human
digestion—the	process	by	which	an	external	substance,	a	piece	of	the	planet,	was	becoming	a
part	of	me.	We	all	know	this	intellectually—that	a	part	of	the	planet	nourishes	us,	and	our
bodies,	in	turn,	one	day	return	to	nourish	the	very	same	earth	that	once	sustained	us.	But	when
the	knowledge	dawned	experientially,	it	altered	my	fundamental	perspective	of	who	I	was.	My
relationship	 with	 everything	 around	 me,	 including	 the	 planet,	 went	 through	 a	 dimensional
shift.

I	 grew	 aware	 of	 that	 extraordinary	 intelligence	 within	 each	 of	 us	 that	 is	 capable	 of
transforming	a	piece	of	bread	or	an	apple	into	the	human	body	in	a	single	afternoon.	Not	a
small	feat!	As	I	began	consciously	touching	that	intelligence,	which	is	the	source	of	creation,
seemingly	 inexplicable	 events	 started	 occurring	 around	 me.	 Things	 that	 I	 touched	 were
transformed	in	some	way	or	the	other.	People	would	look	at	me	and	burst	into	tears.	Many
claimed	that	they	were	relieved	of	conditions	of	physical	and	mental	suffering	just	by	looking
at	me.	I	found	myself	healed	in	a	matter	of	hours	of	conditions	that	would	have	taken	me
months	 to	 get	 out	 of	 through	 normal	 medical	 care.	 However,	 I	 gave	 all	 of	 this	 little
importance.

This	ability	to	transform	my	external	and	internal	reality	quite	dramatically	has	continued
within	me	and	around	me	to	this	very	day.	It	is	not	something	I	have	ever	tried	consciously	to
achieve.	It	is	just	that	once	one	is	in	touch	with	this	deeper	dimension	of	intelligence,	which	is
the	very	basis	of	our	existence	here,	life	turns	quite	naturally	miraculous.

```
In	about	six	to	eight	weeks,	this	incredible	experience	became	a	living	reality.	During	this
```

time,	everything	about	me	changed	dramatically.	My	physical	appearance—the	shape	of	my
eyes,	my	gait,	my	voice,	the	very	alignment	of	my	body—began	changing	so	drastically	that
people	around	me	started	to	notice	as	well.

What	was	happening	inside	me	was	even	more	phenomenal.	Within	six	weeks,	a	huge	flood
of	memory	descended—literally,	lifetimes	of	memory.	I	was	now	aware	of	a	million	different
things	happening	inside	me	in	a	single	moment.	It	was	like	a	kaleidoscope.	My	logical	mind
told	me	none	of	this	could	be	true.	What	I	was	seeing	inside	myself	was	clearer	than	daylight.
But	I	secretly	hoped	it	was	false.	I	had	always	seen	myself	as	a	smart	young	man.	Suddenly	I
appeared	to	be	a	clueless	young	fool,	and	that	bewilderment	was	something	I	could	not	come
to	terms	with.	But	I	found	to	my	chagrin	that	everything	my	memory	was	telling	me	was	true.

Until	this	time,	I	had	completely	refused	to	accept	anything	in	my	life	that	did	not	fit	into	a
rational	and	logical	framework.	Slowly,	I	began	to	realize	that	it	is	life	that	is	the	ultimate
intelligence.	Human	intellect	is	mere	smartness	that	ensures	survival.	But	true	intelligence	is
just	life	and	life—and	that	which	is	the	source	of	life.	Nothing	else.

The	world	has	been	told	that	the	divine	is	love,	that	the	divine	is	compassion.	But	if	you	pay
attention	to	creation,	you	realize	that	the	divine,	or	whatever	is	the	source	of	creation,	is,
above	all,	the	highest	intelligence	that	you	can	imagine.	Instead	of	trying	to	tap	into	this	all-
powerful	intelligence	that	pulsates	within	each	of	us,	we	opt	to	use	our	logical	intellect,	which
is	useful	in	certain	situations,	but	essentially	limited.

I	also	began	to	experience	a	heightened	sensitivity	to	the	feelings	of	others.	Sometimes	just
the	sight	of	an	unknown	person	on	the	street	in	a	state	of	grief	could	make	me	weep.	I	could
not	believe	the	states	of	misery	that	human	beings	were	capable	of	enduring	when	here	I	was,
simply	bursting	with	ecstasy	for	no	reason	at	all.

It	took	a	while	for	me	to	realize	that	what	was	happening	to	me	was	something	“spiritual.”	I
began	to	understand	that	what	the	sacred	traditions	and	scriptures	had	extolled	as	the	ultimate
experience	was	happening	to	me;	that	I	was	experiencing,	in	fact,	the	most	beautiful	thing	that
can	happen	to	a	human	being.

Moment	to	moment	every	cell	in	my	body	was	exploding	with	nameless	ecstasies.	Right
now	people	glorify	childhood	because	a	child	can	laugh	and	be	happy	for	no	reason	at	all.	But
I	saw	that	it	is	possible	to	be	ecstatic	in	one’s	adulthood	as	well.	It	is	possible	for	every	human
being	because	all	we	can	ever	experience	happens	from	 _within_ 	us.

I	 began	 to	 realize	 that	 the	 physical	 transformation	 in	 my	 appearance	 was	 actually	 a
realignment	 of	 my	 entire	 inner	 constitution.	 I	 had	 been	 practicing	 a	 basic	 set	 of	 physical
postures,	or	 _hatha	yoga,_ 	since	I	was	twelve	years	old.	Those	thirteen-odd	years	of	yoga	bore
fruit	at	this	time.	Yoga	is	essentially	a	way	of	re-creating	the	body	so	that	it	serves	a	higher
purpose.	The	human	body	can	function	as	a	piece	of	flesh	and	blood	or	as	the	very	source	of
creation.

There	is	a	whole	technology	for	transforming	the	human	into	the	divine.	The	human	spine
isn’t	just	a	bad	arrangement	of	bones;	it	is	the	very	axis	of	the	universe.	It	just	depends	on	how
you	reorganize	your	system.	In	my	case,	from	being	a	physically	intense	person,	I	learnt	to
carry	my	body	as	if	it	were	not	there	at	all.	My	physicality	became	very	relaxed.	Earlier,	all


that	intensity	was	in	my	body.	People	could	feel	that	if	I	entered	a	room,	it	meant	action.	But
now	I	learned	to	carry	my	body	differently.

And	that	is	when	I	realized	that	this	experience	I	had	had	was	really	yoga.	This	experience
of	union	with	existence,	of	oneness	with	all	life,	of	boundlessness	was	yoga.	The	simple	set	of
yogic	 postures,	 or	 _asanas,_ I’d	 been	 practicing	 daily	 was	 about	 physical	 fitness,	 or	 so	 I
thought.	But	after	that	experience	on	Chamundi	Hill,	I	realized	that	what	I	was	doing	was
actually	a	process	that	could	deliver	me	to	a	dimension	far	beyond	the	physical.	And	that	is
why	I	tell	people:	even	if	you	get	into	yoga	for	the	wrong	reasons,	it	still	works!

There	is	something	within	every	human	being	that	dislikes	boundaries,	that	is	longing	to
become	boundless.	Human	nature	is	such	that	we	always	yearn	to	be	something	more	than
what	we	are	right	now.	No	matter	how	much	we	achieve,	we	still	want	to	be	something	more.
If	 we	 just	 looked	 at	 this	 closely,	 we	 would	 realize	 that	 this	 longing	 is	 not	 for	 more;	 this
longing	is	for	 _all_ .	We	are	all	seeking	to	become	infinite.	The	only	problem	is	that	we	are
seeking	it	in	installments.

Imagine	that	you	were	locked	up	in	a	cubicle	of	five	feet	by	five	feet.	However	comfortable
it	is,	you	would	long	to	be	free	of	it.	The	next	day,	if	you	were	released	into	a	larger	cubicle
of	ten	feet	by	ten	feet,	you	would	feel	great	for	a	while,	but	soon	the	same	longing	to	break
that	boundary	would	return.	It	does	not	matter	how	large	a	boundary	we	set,	the	moment	you
become	conscious	of	it,	the	longing	to	break	it	is	instinctive.	In	the	East,	this	longing	has	been
culturally	recognized	as	the	highest	goal	of	all	human	activity	and	endeavor.	Freedom—or
_mukti_ or	 _moksha_ —is	 seen	 as	 the	 natural	 longing	 in	 every	 human	 being	 and	 our	 ultimate
destination.	It	is	just	because	we	are	unconscious	of	it	that	we	seek	to	fulfill	it	in	installments,
whether	through	the	acquisition	of	power,	money,	love,	or	knowledge.	Or	through	that	other
great	pastime	of	today—shopping!

The	moment	I	realized	that	human	desire	was	not	for	any	particular	thing,	but	just	to	expand
illimitably,	a	certain	clarity	rose	within	me.	When	I	saw	that	everyone	is	capable	of	this,	it	felt
natural	to	want	to	share	it.	My	whole	aim	since	then	has	been	to	somehow	rub	this	experience
off	 on	 other	 people,	 to	 awaken	 them	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 this	 state	 of	 joy,	 of	 freedom,	 of
limitlessness	 cannot	 be	 denied	 to	 them	 unless	 they	 stand	 in	 the	 way	 of	 the	 natural
effervescence	of	life.

This	condition	of	ecstatic	well-being	that	has	been	mine	since	that	afternoon	on	Chamundi
Hill	is	neither	a	distant	possibility	nor	a	pipe	dream.	It	is	a	living	reality	for	those	who	are
willing.	It	is	the	birthright	of	every	human	being.


Everything	you	have	done	in	your	life	so	far	has	been	in	pursuit	of	a	single	thing.	Whether
you	sought	a	career,	started	a	business,	made	money,	or	built	a	family,	it	was	always	because
you	wanted	just	one	simple	thing:	joy.

But	somewhere	along	the	way,	life	got	complicated.
If	you	had	been	born	as	any	other	creature	on	this	planet,	it	would	have	been	very	simple.
Your	needs	would	have	just	been	physical.	A	full	stomach	would	have	been	equivalent	to	a
great	day.	Take	a	look	at	your	dog	or	your	cat:	the	moment	their	stomach	is	full,	they	are	quite
peaceful.

But	when	you	come	into	this	world	as	a	human	being,	things	change.	An	empty	stomach	is
one	 problem:	 hunger.	 But	 a	 full	 stomach?	 A	 hundred	 problems!	 When	 our	 survival	 is	 in
question,	it	is	a	big	issue	in	our	lives.	But	the	moment	it	is	taken	care	of,	it	doesn’t	seem	to
mean	anything.	Somehow,	for	a	human	being,	life	doesn’t	seem	to	end	with	survival;	life
_begins_ 	with	survival.

Today,	as	a	generation	of	people,	our	survival	process	is	better	organized	than	ever	before.
You	can	go	to	a	supermarket	and	buy	everything	you	need	for	the	entire	year.	You	can	do	it
without	even	stepping	out	of	your	home!	Never	before	in	the	history	of	humanity	has	such	a
thing	 been	 possible.	 Things	 that	 even	 royalty	 could	 not	 afford	 a	 hundred	 years	 ago	 are
accessible	to	the	average	citizen.	We	are	the	most	comfortable	generation	to	have	ever	lived
on	this	planet.	The	rub	is	that	we	are	definitely	not	the	most	joyful,	or	the	most	loving,	or	the
most	peaceful.

Why	is	this	so?	We	have	tried	our	best	to	fix	the	outside	environment.	If	we	fix	it	any	more,
there	will	be	no	planet	left!	But	we	are	still	no	happier	than	our	ancestors	a	thousand	years
ago.	If	it	is	not	working,	isn’t	it	time	to	look	at	what’s	wrong?	How	can	we	continue	to	do
something	that	has	not	worked	for	a	thousand	years?	How	much	longer	are	we	going	to	live
with	blueprints	that	clearly	haven’t	delivered	their	promise?

```
It	is	time	for	a	paradigm	shift.
```
Let	us	start	with	a	single	question:	what	do	we	consider	to	be	a	state	of	well-being?


Very	 simply,	 well-being	 is	 just	 a	 deep	 sense	 of	 _pleasantness_ within.	 If	 your	 body	 feels
pleasant,	we	call	this	health.	If	it	becomes	very	pleasant,	we	call	this	pleasure.	If	your	mind
becomes	pleasant,	we	call	this	peace.	If	it	becomes	very	pleasant,	we	call	this	joy.	If	your
emotions	 become	 pleasant,	 we	 call	 this	 love.	 If	 they	 become	 very	 pleasant,	 we	 call	 this
compassion.	If	your	life	energies	become	pleasant,	we	call	this	bliss.	If	they	become	very
pleasant,	we	call	this	ecstasy.	This	is	all	that	you	are	seeking:	pleasantness	within	and	without.
When	 pleasantness	 is	 within,	 it	 is	 termed	 peace,	 joy,	 happiness.	 When	 your	 surroundings
become	pleasant,	it	gets	branded	success.	If	you’re	not	interested	in	any	of	this	and	want	to	go
to	 heaven,	 what	 are	 you	 seeking?	 Just	 otherworldly	 success!	 So,	 essentially	 all	 human
experience	is	only	a	question	of	pleasantness	and	unpleasantness	in	varying	degrees.

But	how	many	times	in	your	life	have	you	lived	an	entire	day	blissfully—without	a	single
moment	of	anxiety,	agitation,	irritation,	or	stress?	How	many	times	have	you	lived	in	utter
and	absolute	pleasantness	for	twenty-four	hours?	When	was	the	last	time	it	happened	to	you?

The	amazing	thing	is	that	for	most	people	on	this	planet,	not	a	 _single_ 	day	has	happened
exactly	the	way	they	want	it!	Of	course,	there	is	no	one	who	has	not	experienced	joy,	peace,
even	bliss,	but	it	is	always	fleeting.	They	are	unable	to	sustain	it.	They	manage	to	get	there,	but
it	 keeps	 collapsing.	 And	 nothing	 earth-shattering	 needs	 to	 happen	 for	 it	 to	 collapse.	 The
simplest	things	throw	people	off	balance,	out	of	kilter.

It	is	like	this.	You	go	out	today	and	someone	tells	you	that	you	are	the	most	beautiful	person
in	the	world:	you’re	floating	on	cloud	nine.	But	then	you	come	home,	and	the	folks	at	home
tell	you	who	you	 _really_ 	are:	everything	crashes!

Sound	familiar?
Why	do	you	need	to	be	pleasant	within?	The	answer	is	self-evident.	When	you	are	in	a
pleasant	inner	state,	you	are	naturally	pleasant	to	everyone	and	everything	around	you.	No
scripture	or	philosophy	is	needed	to	instruct	you	to	be	good	to	others.	It	is	a	natural	outcome
when	you	are	feeling	good	within	yourself.	Inner	pleasantness	is	a	surefire	insurance	for	the
making	of	a	peaceful	society	and	a	joyful	world.

Besides,	 your	 success	 in	 the	 world	 depends	 essentially	 on	 how	 well	 you	 harness	 the
prowess	of	the	body	and	mind.	So,	in	order	to	achieve	success,	pleasantness	has	to	be	the
fundamental	quality	within	you.

Above	all,	there	is	substantial	medical	and	scientific	evidence	today	that	your	body	and
mind	function	at	their	best	when	you	are	in	a	pleasant	state.	It	is	said	that	if	you	can	remain
blissful	 for	 twenty-four	 hours,	 your	 intellectual	 capabilities	 can	 be	 almost	 doubled.	 Just
settling	the	internal	muddle	and	allowing	clarity	to	surface	can	achieve	this.

Now,	the	same	life	energy	that	you	refer	to	as	“myself”	has	sometimes	been	very	happy,
sometimes	 miserable,	 sometimes	 peaceful,	 sometimes	 in	 turmoil.	 The	 same	 life	 energy	 is
capable	of	all	those	states.	So,	if	you	were	given	a	choice	about	the	kind	of	expression	your
life	 energies	 should	 find,	 what	 would	 you	 choose?	 Joy	 or	 misery?	 Pleasantness	 or
unpleasantness?

The	answer	is	self-evident.	The	ways	may	vary	from	person	to	person.	But	whether	you’re
trying	to	make	money,	hitting	the	bottle,	or	attempting	to	get	to	heaven,	pleasantness	is	the


only	goal.	Even	if	you	say	you	are	not	interested	in	this	world	and	your	mission	in	life	is	only
to	get	to	heaven,	you’re	still	only	searching	for	pleasantness.	If	people	had	told	you	since
your	childhood	that	God	lives	in	heaven,	but	heaven	is	a	horrendous	place,	would	you	want	to
go	 there?	 Definitely	 not!	 Essentially,	 the	 highest	 level	 of	 pleasantness	 is	 heaven;
unpleasantness	is	hell.	So,	some	think	it’s	in	the	wine,	and	others	think	it’s	in	the	divine,	but
pleasantness	is	what	everyone’s	seeking.

The	 only	 thing	 that	 stands	 between	 you	 and	 your	 well-being	 is	 a	 simple	 fact:	 you	 have
allowed	your	thoughts	and	emotions	to	take	instruction	from	the	outside	rather	than	the	inside.

On	a	certain	day,	a	lady	went	to	sleep.	In	her	sleep,	she	had	a	dream.	She	saw	a	hunk	of	a
man,	staring	at	her.	Then	he	started	coming	closer—closer	and	closer.

He	was	so	close	that	she	could	even	feel	his	breath.
She	trembled—not	in	fear.
Then	she	asked,	“What	will	you	do	to	me?”
The	man	said,	“Well,	lady,	it’s	 _your_ 	dream!”
What’s	happening	in	your	head	is	 _your_ 	dream.	At	least	your	dream	should	happen	the	way
you	want	it,	shouldn’t	it?	Even	if	the	world	doesn’t	happen	the	way	you	want	it,	at	least	your
thoughts	 and	 emotions	 should	 happen	 the	 way	 you	 want	 them	 to.	 Right	 now,	 these	 aren’t
taking	 instructions	 from	 you	 because	 you	 are	 handling	 the	 whole	 human	 mechanism
accidentally.

The	human	mechanism	is	the	most	sophisticated	physical	form	on	the	planet.	You	are	the
greatest	piece	of	technology,	but	the	problem	is	you	don’t	know	where	the	keyboard	is.	It’s
like	you’re	handling	a	supercomputer	with	a	pickaxe	and	a	wrench!	As	a	result,	the	simple	life
process	is	taking	a	toll	upon	humanity.	Just	to	earn	a	living,	to	reproduce,	to	raise	a	family,
and	then	one	day	to	fall	dead—what	a	challenge!	It	is	amazing	how	human	beings	struggle	just
to	do	what	every	worm,	insect,	bird,	and	animal	does	quite	effortlessly.

Put	simply,	our	inner	ecology	is	a	mess.	Somehow	we	think	that	fixing	outer	conditions
will	make	everything	okay	on	the	inside.	But	these	past	150	years	are	proof	that	technology
will	only	bring	comfort	and	convenience	to	us,	not	well-being.	We	need	to	understand	that
_unless	we	do	the	right	things,	the	right	things	will	not	happen	to	us:_ 	this	is	true	not	just	of	the
outside	world,	but	also	the	inside.

On	a	certain	day,	a	bull	and	a	pheasant	were	grazing	on	a	field.	The	bull	was	grazing	and	the
pheasant	was	picking	ticks	off	the	bull—a	perfect	partnership.	Looking	at	the	huge	tree	at	the
edge	of	the	field,	the	pheasant	said,	“Alas,	there	was	a	time	I	could	fly	to	the	topmost	branch
of	the	tree.	Now	I	do	not	have	enough	strength	in	my	wing	to	even	get	to	the	first	branch.”

The	 bull	 said	 nonchalantly,	 “Just	 eat	 a	 little	 bit	 of	 my	 dung	 every	 day,	 and	 watch	 what
happens.	Within	two	weeks,	you’ll	get	to	the	top.”


The	pheasant	said,	“Oh	come	on,	that’s	rubbish.	What	kind	of	nonsense	is	that?”
The	bull	said,	“Try	it	and	see.	The	whole	of	humanity	is	onto	it.”
Very	hesitantly,	the	pheasant	started	pecking.	And	lo,	on	the	very	first	day,	he	reached	the
first	 branch.	 Within	 a	 fortnight,	 he	 had	 reached	 the	 topmost	 branch.	 He	 sat	 there,	 just
beginning	to	enjoy	the	scenery.

The	old	farmer,	rocking	on	his	rocking	chair,	saw	a	fat	old	pheasant	on	top	of	the	tree.	He
pulled	out	his	shotgun	and	shot	the	bird	off	the	tree.

Moral	of	the	story:	bullshit	may	get	you	to	the	top,	but	it	never	lets	you	stay	there!
So,	you	can	bullshit	yourself	into	all	kinds	of	emotional	states,	you	can	somehow	crank	up
some	well-being	for	yourself,	but	the	problem	is,	it	doesn’t	last.	The	weather	could	bring	it
down.	The	stock	market	could	make	it	come	crashing	down.	And	even	if	it	does	not	collapse,
living	in	anticipation	that	it	might	is	bad	enough!	The	impending	possibility	that	it	will	fall
apart	one	day	is	torture—often	worse	than	the	actual	disaster.	So,	as	long	as	your	inner	life	is
enslaved	to	external	situations,	it	will	remain	a	precarious	condition.	There	is	no	other	way
for	it	to	be.

What	then	is	the	way	out?
The	way	out	is	a	very	simple	change	in	direction.	You	just	need	to	see	that	the	source	and
basis	of	your	experience	is	 _within_ 	you.	Human	experience	may	be	stimulated	or	catalyzed	by
external	situations,	but	the	source	is	within.	Pain	or	pleasure,	joy	or	misery,	agony	or	ecstasy,
happens	only	inside	you.	Human	folly	is	that	people	are	always	trying	to	extract	joy	from	the
outside.	You	may	use	the	outside	as	a	stimulus	or	trigger,	but	the	real	thing	always	comes
from	within.

Right	now,	you	are	holding	a	book.	Where	do	you	see	the	book?	Use	your	finger	and	point
to	where	you	see	it.	Do	you	think	the	image	is	outside	you?

Think	again.
You	remember	how	it	works?	The	light	is	falling	upon	the	book,	reflecting,	going	into	the
lens	of	your	eyes,	and	projected	as	an	inverted	image	on	your	retina—you	know	the	whole
story.	So,	you	are	actually	seeing	the	book	 _within_ 	yourself.

Where	do	you	see	the	whole	world?
Again,	within	yourself.
Everything	 that	 ever	 happened	 to	 you,	 you	 experienced	 _right	 within	 you_ .	 Light	 and
darkness,	pain	and	pleasure,	agony	and	ecstasy—all	of	it	happened	within	you.	If	someone
touches	your	hand	right	now,	you	may	think	you	are	experiencing	their	hand,	but	the	fact	of
the	 matter	 is	 you	 are	 only	 experiencing	 the	 sensations	 in	 your	 own	 hand.	 The	 whole
experience	is	contained	within.	 _All	human	experience	is	one	hundred	percent	self-created._

If	your	thought	and	your	emotion	are	of	your	making,	you	can	mold	them	any	way	you
like.	There	is	scientific	proof	today	that	without	ingesting	a	drop	of	alcohol	or	any	other
substance,	 you	 can	 get	 fully	 intoxicated	 by	 yourself.	 An	 Israeli	 organic	 chemist,	 Raphael
Mechoulam,	 and	 his	 research	 team	 initiated	 a	 project	 that	 eventually	 isolated	 a	 “bliss
molecule”	in	the	human	system.	In	lay	terms,	they	discovered	that	the	human	brain	has	natural


cannabis	receptors.	Why	is	this	so?	They	found	that	this	is	simply	because	the	body	is	capable
of	producing	its	own	narcotic.	It	can	manufacture	its	own	bliss	with	no	external	stimulus—and
that	too,	with	no	hangover!	The	reason	why	certain	chemical	substances,	like	alcohol	and
recreational	 drugs,	 are	 dangerous	 is	 because	 they	 can	 reduce	 your	 awareness,	 ruin	 your
health,	 create	 addictions,	 and	 destroy	 you.	 But	 here	 is	 a	 bliss	 narcotic	 that	 is	 created	 and
consumed	 by	 your	 own	 system—and	 which	 has	 a	 tremendous	 impact	 on	 health	 and	 well-
being!	It	means	that	the	human	system	is	wonderfully	self-contained.	Other	similar	chemicals
have	 been	 discovered	 more	 recently	 as	 well,	 but	 this	 particular	 chemical	 has	 been	 named
“anandamide,”	based	on	the	Sanskrit	word	 _ananda,_ 	which	means	bliss.	We	can	infer	from	this
that	happiness	is	just	a	certain	kind	of	chemistry.	Peace	is	another	kind	of	chemistry.	In	fact,
every	kind	of	pleasantness	that	we	experience—whether	peace	or	joy	or	ecstasy—is	a	kind	of
chemistry.	The	yogic	system	has	always	known	this.

There	is	a	technology	for	inner	well-being—for	creating	a	chemical	basis	for	a	blissful
existence.	This	is	one	dimension	of	what	I	call	“Inner	Engineering.”	If	you	are	aware,	you	can
activate	your	system	in	such	a	way	that	simply	breathing	is	an	enormous	pleasure.	All	it	takes
is	a	willingness	to	pay	a	little	attention	to	the	inner	mechanism.

This	is	the	fundamental	shift	in	understanding	that	has	to	happen.	Do	not	look	for	a	way	out
of	misery.	Do	not	look	for	a	way	out	of	suffering.	There	is	only	one	way—and	that	is	 _in_.

Most	people	think	peace	and	joy	are	the	goals	of	the	spiritual	life.	This	is	a	fallacy.	Peace	and
joy	 are	 the	 basic	 requirements	 for	 a	 life	 of	 well-being.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 enjoy	 your	 dinner
tonight,	you	must	be	peaceful	and	happy.	If	you	want	to	enjoy	your	family,	the	work	that	you
do,	the	world	that	you	live	in,	you	must	be	peaceful	and	happy.	Peace	and	joy	are	not	things
you	attain	at	the	end	of	life.	They	are	the	basis	of	your	life.	If	you	consider	peace	to	be	the
ultimate	goal,	you	will	only	“rest	in	peace”!

The	word	“spirituality”	is	one	of	the	most	corrupted	words	on	the	planet.	Don’t	walk	the
spiritual	path	for	peace.	It	is	because	most	people	are	so	deprived	of	peace	that	they	consider
it	to	be	the	ultimate	aspiration.	When	I	was	in	Tel	Aviv	some	years	ago,	I	was	told	that	 _shalom_
was	the	highest	form	of	greeting	possible.	I	asked	why.	“Because	it	means	peace,”	I	was	told.	I
said,	“Why	would	peace	be	the	highest	aspiration	unless	you’re	in	the	Middle	East?”

If	you	were	on	a	desert	island	without	food	for	ten	days	and	suddenly	God	appeared	before
you,	would	you	want	Him	to	appear	as	a	shining	light	or	in	the	form	of	bread?	In	India	certain
communities	worship	food	as	God	because	they	have	been	deprived	of	food	for	a	long	time.
In	California,	love	is	God!	Whatever	you	feel	deprived	of	looks	like	the	highest	aspiration.
The	thing	to	remember	is	that	none	of	these	will	settle	you	in	any	enduring	way.	Human	life	is
longing	for	unlimited	expansion,	and	that	is	the	 _only_ 	thing	that	will	settle	you	for	good.

The	 spiritual	 quest	 is	 not	 a	 cultivated	 choice.	 It	 is	 not	 an	 induced	 quest.	 It	 is	 a	 natural
longing.	But	unless	you	handle	it	consciously,	it	will	not	yield.	When	being	peaceful,	blissful,


and	joyous	are	not	efforts	anymore,	you	naturally	start	seeking,	want	to	know	the	nature	of
life.	 Mysticism	 on	 this	 planet	 evolved	 only	 in	 those	 places	 where	 people	 learned	 the
technology	of	being	ecstatic	by	their	own	nature.	This	is	because	only	when	you	are	blissful
will	you	be	in	the	highest	state	of	receptivity,	and	truly	willing	to	explore	all	aspects	of	life.
Otherwise,	you	would	not	dare,	because	if	keeping	yourself	pleasant	is	a	big	challenge,	you
can’t	take	on	other	challenges.

Once	it	happened...An	eighty-five-year-old	man	went	fishing	in	Louisiana.	When	he	was
just	about	to	call	it	a	day,	he	caught	a	frog.	He	was	about	to	release	it	into	the	marsh	again,
when	the	frog	spoke.	“Just	kiss	me	passionately,”	it	said,	“and	I	will	turn	into	a	beautiful
young	woman.”

The	 old	 man	 inspected	 the	 frog	 for	 a	 long	 time.	 The	 frog	 puckered	 up	 its	 lips	 in
anticipation.	Then	the	old	man	put	the	frog	into	his	fish	bag.

The	 frog	 screamed,	 “Didn’t	 you	 hear	 me?	 Just	 one	 kiss	 and	 I	 will	 turn	 into	 a	 really
beautiful	young	woman!”

The	old	man	said,	“At	my	age,	there’s	not	much	I	can	do	with	a	beautiful	young	woman.	If
kissing	you	could	turn	me	into	a	handsome	young	prince,	that	would	be	different.	But	for	now
—a	talking	frog!	Believe	me,	I	can	smell	money!”

Choices	that	you	make	out	of	inability	are	not	life	solutions.	An	inability	to	be	joyful	by
your	own	nature	can	make	the	simplest	issues	in	life	seem	like	highly	complex	problems.
Right	now	being	peaceful	and	joyful	is	made	out	to	be	the	most	significant	problem	in	human
existence.	In	pursuit	of	human	happiness,	we	are	ripping	the	planet	apart.

The	reason	the	simple	things—like	being	peaceful,	joyful,	loving—have	become	ultimate
aspirations	is	that	people	are	living	without	paying	any	attention	to	the	life	process.	When
most	 people	 say	 “life,”	 they	 mean	 the	 accessories	 of	 life—their	 work,	 their	 family,	 their
relationships,	the	homes	they	live	in,	the	cars	they	drive,	the	clothes	they	wear,	or	the	gods
they	pray	to.	The	one	thing	they	miss	is	 _life_ —the	life	process	itself,	the	essential	life	that	is
you.	The	moment	you	make	this	fundamental	mistake	of	identifying	something	that	is	not	you
as	yourself,	life	becomes	an	unnecessary	struggle.	The	foundations	of	peace	and	bliss	are	not
about	attending	to	the	external	realities	of	your	life,	but	in	accessing	and	organizing	the	inner
nature	of	your	being.

You	are	capable	of	experiencing	only	that	which	is	within	the	boundaries	of	your	sensation.
But	if	you	throw	the	boundary	of	your	sensation	out	in	an	expanded	form,	you	can	sit	here
and	 experience	 everyone	 as	 yourself.	 You	 can	 stretch	 it	 further	 and	 experience	 the	 very
cosmos	as	you	experience	your	own	body.

When	 this	 sense	 of	 inclusiveness	 happened	 to	 me,	 I	 understood	 that	 being	 loving	 and
compassionate	is	not	an	idea.	To	live	in	empathy	is	not	some	esoteric	principle.	This	is	the
way	a	human	being	is	 _made_ .	If	you	do	not	identify	with	anything	you	have	accumulated	over	a
period	of	time,	 _including	your	body	and	mind,_ 	you	will	be	able	to	experience	this.

Enlightenment	is	not	an	attainment	or	an	achievement.	It	is	a	homecoming.	Your	senses	give
you	the	impression	that	you	are	experiencing	the	outside,	but	you	have	never	experienced	the
outside.	When	you	realize	that	all	that	you	experience	is	within,	that	absolute	homecoming	is


enlightenment.

My	life	is	just	devoted	to	evolving	methods	so	that	people	can	experience	this	inclusiveness.
If	 we	 truly	 have	 to	 create	 solutions	 that	 are	 relevant	 for	 all,	 an	 experience	 of	 absolute
inclusiveness	has	to	happen	to	humanity.	And	it	is	possible.

The	 reason	 why	 everyone	 is	 not	 naturally	 enlightened	 is	 simply	 this:	 people	 have
categorized	the	world	into	good	and	bad,	God	and	Devil,	high	and	low,	sacred	and	filthy,	pure
and	impure,	heaven	and	hell.	These	are	parallel	lines	that	will	never	meet.

Once	you	have	fractured	this	existence	within	yourself,	there	is	no	way	to	reach	a	state	of
enduring	well-being	and	freedom.	You	have	been	told	to	love	your	enemy.	If	you	first	label
someone	your	enemy	and	then	try	to	love	him	or	her,	it’s	going	to	be	torturous!	Once	you
have	 fragmented	 creation	 like	 this,	 there	 is	 no	 way	 to	 arrive	 at	 a	 state	 of	 absolute
inclusiveness.

The	problem	is	that	human	beings	have	lost	a	fundamental	distinction—between	inward	and
outward,	 between	 their	 way	 of	 _being_ and	 the	 way	 they	 _transact_ with	 the	 external	 world.
Transactions	are	different,	according	to	the	nature	of	a	situation	or	relationship.	However
remote	or	intimate,	transactions	are	always	governed	by	laws	or	norms.

But	when	it	comes	to	our	inner	nature,	there	is	only	one	governing	principle:	 _borderless
unity_ .	Our	physical	and	social	worlds	are	governed	by	boundaries.	Our	inner	world	needs
none.	To	attain	the	ecstasy	of	borderless	unity,	which	is	our	natural	state,	all	you	need	to	do	is
live	 by	 the	 guideline	 that	 all	 human	 experience	 is	 generated	 from	 within—either	 with	 the
support	 of	 external	 stimuli	 or	 without.	 That	 is	 all.	 If	 you	 establish	 this	 within	 yourself
absolutely,	the	consequences	of	your	transactions	will	no	longer	be	burdensome.

What	do	we	mean	by	this?	People	often	ask	me,	“Maybe	this	is	possible	for	you	as	a	yogi,
but	how	can	we	who	live	in	the	‘real	world’	make	our	interactions	free	of	friction?”	I	remind
them	that	I	don’t	live	in	a	cave.	I	also	lead	people.	I	am	doing	work	around	the	world	with
over	one	million	volunteers.	This	means	they	usually	aren’t	trained	for	the	job	they	are	doing
— _and_ 	you	can’t	fire	them!	Do	you	know	how	difficult	it	is	to	manage	such	a	situation?	By
implication,	my	life	should	be	the	most	burdensome!	But	you	won’t	ever	see	me	distressed
because	my	way	of	being	is	not	in	any	way	enslaved	to	what’s	happening	outside.	This	is	not
an	otherworldly	achievement.	It	is	possible	for	everyone	to	live	this	way.

If	 you	 still	 believe	 that	 someone	 “up	 there”	 is	 going	 to	 rescue	 you	 and	 solve	 all	 your
problems,	just	remember	that	you	are	living	on	a	round	planet—and	one	that’s	spinning.	So,
whenever	you	look	up,	you	are	obviously	looking	in	the	wrong	direction!	In	this	vast	ever-
expanding	cosmos,	what’s	up	and	what’s	down?	You	have	no	clue.	Nowhere	in	the	cosmos	is
it	 marked	 “This	 side	 up”!	 The	 only	 distinction	 you	 do	 know	 right	 now	 is	 “within”	 and
“without”	(although,	for	the	yogi,	even	this	distinction	has	vanished).

Thousands	of	years	ago,	a	yogi	appeared	in	the	upper	reaches	of	the	Himalayas.	He	came	to
be	known	as	Adiyogi,	the	first	yogi.	And	it	was	he	who	bequeathed	the	science	of	yoga	to
seven	disciples,	who	later	carried	it	around	the	world.	What	he	imparted	to	these	disciples	was
an	 unimaginably	 profound	 system	 of	 self-exploration	 and	 transformation,	 based	 on	 the
radical	premise	that	it	is	possible	for	a	human	being	to	evolve	 _consciously_ .	Unlike	biological


evolution,	which	happens	without	our	conscious	participation,	spiritual	evolution	can	happen
consciously.	All	it	takes,	Adiyogi	told	us,	is	willingness.

If	we	were	to	distill	the	essence	of	his	wisdom	in	a	few	lines,	it	would	be	just	this.	Up	and
down,	good	and	bad,	sacred	and	profane:	these	are	all	assumed.	But	inward	and	outward:	this
is	the	one	context	we	are	sure	of,	the	one	context	we	can	work	with.	This	is	Adiyogi’s	most
significant	contribution	to	humankind	and	it	is	a	profound	and	enduring	one:	“The	only	way
out	is	 _in_ .”

Once	 it	 happened...Someone	 came	 looking	 for	 the	 Isha	 Yoga	 Center	 in	 southern	 India.
They	came	to	a	nearby	village	and	asked	a	local	boy,	“How	far	is	the	Isha	Yoga	Center?”

The	boy	scratched	his	head	and	said,	“24,996	miles.”
The	man	was	aghast.	“What?	That	far?”
The	boy	said,	“Yes,	the	way	you’re	going.	But	if	you	turn	around,	it’s	just	four	miles.”
If	you	go	outward,	it	is	an	endless	journey.	If	you	turn	inward,	it	is	just	one	moment.
In	that	one	moment,	everything	changes.	In	that	one	moment,	you	are	not	in	pursuit	of	joy
anymore.	Instead,	your	life	becomes	 _an	expression_ 	of	your	joyfulness.


I	was	once	at	an	international	conference	on	how	to	alleviate	poverty	on	the	planet.	There
were	several	eminent	participants	in	positions	of	public	responsibility,	including	a	generous
sprinkling	of	Nobel	laureates.

At	one	point,	a	participant	said,	“Why	are	we	trying	to	solve	these	problems?	Isn’t	all	this
divine	will?”

And	I	said,	“Yes,	if	somebody	else	is	dying,	somebody	else	is	hungry,	it	must	be	divine	will.
But	if	 _your_ 	stomach	is	empty,	if	 _your_ 	child	is	dying	of	hunger,	you’ll	have	your	own	plan,
won’t	you?”

Whenever	we	have	had	to	do	something	about	 _our_ 	lives,	we	have	taken	it	into	our	hands.
Whenever	it	comes	to	other	people’s	misfortunes,	we	have	a	word	to	explain	it:	destiny.

And	what	a	convenient	word	that	is.	Destiny	has	become	a	popular	scapegoat,	a	way	to	deal
with	failure,	a	fatalistic	ruse	to	reconcile	ourselves	to	all	kinds	of	uncomfortable	situations.
But	turning	inward	is	the	first	step	from	passivity	to	agency—from	being	a	victim	toward
becoming	a	master	of	your	own	destiny.

A	variety	of	diseases	that	people	believed	to	be	“God’s	will”	until	a	hundred	years	ago,	are
in	our	hands	today.	This	is	because	we	have	taken	charge	of	certain	situations.	Polio	is	an
example.	The	very	word	“polio”	would	strike	terror	in	the	hearts	of	many	in	recent	history.
When	I	was	growing	up,	I	saw	quite	a	few	polio-afflicted	people	about	my	age,	in	school	and
in	 my	 neighborhood,	 who	 were	 doomed	 to	 live	 out	 their	 lives	 in	 wheelchairs.	 It	 was	 a
common	sight,	and	it	was	an	acknowledged	fact	that	they	would	never	be	able	to	walk	in	their
lives.	Their	affliction	was	usually	seen	as	an	act	of	God	or	destiny.

At	the	start	of	the	twentieth	century,	polio	was	the	most	feared	ailment	in	industrialized
countries,	irreversibly	paralyzing	thousands	of	children.	Effective	vaccines	helped	practically
eliminate	this	disease	in	the	1950s	and	’60s.	When	it	was	recognized	as	a	major	problem	in
developing	 countries,	 immunization	 programs	 were	 introduced.	 In	 1988,	 polio	 afflicted
350,000	children	around	the	world	in	a	single	year;	in	2013,	the	number	had	dropped	to	416.
By	 2012,	 India	 was	 no	 longer	 on	 the	 list	 of	 polio-endemic	 countries.	 A	 combination	 of
political	 advocacy,	 public	 and	 private	 partnerships,	 effective	 reasonably	 priced	 vaccines,
community	participation,	and	teams	of	global	healthcare	workers,	proved	that	despite	all	the
obstacles,	even	in	a	country	as	vast	and	challenging	as	India,	eradication	 _was_ 	possible.

```
To	be	human	means	you	can	mold	situations	you	are	living	in	the	way	you	want	them.	But
```

today	most	people	in	the	world	are	molded	by	the	situations	in	which	they	exist.	This	is	simply
because	they	live	in	reaction	to	situations	they	are	placed	in.	The	inevitable	question	is,	“Why
was	 I	 placed	 in	 such	 a	 situation?	 Isn’t	 it	 my	 destiny?”	 Whatever	 we	 do	 not	 want	 to	 take
responsibility	 for,	 whatever	 we	 cannot	 make	 sense	 of	 logically,	 we	 label	 “destiny.”	 It	 is	 a
consoling	word,	but	disempowering.

To	mold	situations	the	way	you	want	them	you	must	first	know	who	you	are.	The	crux	of
the	 matter	 is	 that	 you	 don’t	 yet	 know	 who	 you	 are.	 Who	 you	 are	 is	 not	 the	 sum	 total	 of
accumulations	 you	 have	 made.	 Everything	 that	 you	 currently	 know	 as	 “myself”	 is	 just	 an
accumulation.	Your	body	is	just	an	accumulation	of	food.	Your	mind	is	just	an	accumulation
of	impressions	gathered	through	the	five	senses.	What	you	accumulate	can	be	yours,	but	it	can
never	be	you.

Who	then	 _are_ 	you?	That	is	yet	to	come	into	your	experience.	That	is	still	in	an	unconscious
state.	You	are	trying	to	live	your	life	through	what	you	have	gathered,	not	through	who	you
_are_ .	What’s	more,	you	are	not	even	a	hundred	percent	conscious	of	what	you	have	gathered!

You	have	acquired	certain	tendencies	over	the	years,	depending	on	the	impressions	you
have	accumulated.	These	can	be	transformed	entirely.	If	you	do	a	certain	amount	of	inner
work,	if	you	implement	certain	inner	technologies—irrespective	of	your	current	tendencies,
your	past	experience	of	life,	your	genetics,	your	environment—you	can	completely	rewire
yourself	in	a	short	span	of	time!

Everything	in	this	existence	is	happening	naturally	according	to	a	certain	organic	law.	If
you	know	the	nature	of	life	within	you,	you	can	completely	take	charge	of	the	way	it	happens,
but	within	the	broad	parameters	set	by	the	laws	of	nature.	What	do	we	mean	by	this?	Let	us
look	at	a	concrete	example.	Although	we	are	wingless	creatures,	we	have	still,	in	the	last	one
hundred	years,	managed	to	fly.	How?	Not	by	breaking	the	laws	of	nature,	but	through	a	deeper
understanding	of	the	laws	of	nature.	So,	the	technology	we	are	going	to	explore	in	this	book
is	a	small	part	of	the	much	deeper	science	that	eventually	enables	an	adept	to	take	the	very
process	of	life	and	death	into	his	or	her	hands.

Your	destiny	is	written	by	you	 _unconsciously_ .	If	you	have	mastery	over	your	physical	body,
fifteen	to	twenty	percent	of	your	life	and	destiny	will	be	in	your	hands.	If	you	have	mastery
over	your	mind,	fifty	to	sixty	percent	of	your	life	and	destiny	will	be	in	your	hands.	If	you
have	mastery	over	your	life	energies,	 _a	 hundred	 percent_ 	of	your	life	and	destiny	will	be	in
your	hands.

Even	now	you	are	choosing	your	life,	but	you	are	choosing	it	in	total	unawareness.	But
whatever	you	do	in	unawareness,	you	can	also	do	in	awareness.	That	makes	a	world	of	a
difference.	It	is	the	difference	between	ignorance	and	enlightenment.

Unpleasantness	is	happening	to	you,	in	the	form	of	anger,	fear,	anxiety,	and	stress,	because
your	basic	faculties—your	body,	mind,	and	life	energies—are	doing	their	own	thing.	When
mind	and	body	exist	only	to	serve	the	life	within	you,	why	is	your	life	currently	enslaved	to
the	mind	and	body?	Isn’t	this	a	complete	distortion	of	the	way	life	should	function?

Taking	destiny	into	your	hands	doesn’t	mean	everything	will	happen	your	way.	The	outside
world	will	never	happen	a	hundred	percent	your	way,	because	there	are	too	many	variables


involved.	Wanting	the	outside	to	happen	exactly	the	way	you	choose	is	the	path	of	conquest,
tyranny,	dictatorship.

Once	 it	 happened...Shankaran	 Pillai	 (a	 certain	 South	 Indian	 gentleman	 you	 met	 in	 the
introduction	and	will	meet	several	times	more	in	the	course	of	this	book)	went	drinking	with
his	buddies.	He	thought	he	would	have	a	quick	drink	and	go	home	at	eight	o’clock.	And	so	he
did.	He	had	a	quick	drink,	and	a	quick	drink,	and	another	quick	drink.	And	then	one	more
quick	 drink.	 He	 looked	 at	 his	 watch.	 It	 said	 two	 thirty.	 (Drink	 makes	 people	 like	 yogis—
timeless.)	He	got	off	the	barstool.	It	is	such	an	unfair	world:	a	man	is	expected	to	walk	on	a
round	planet	that	spins.	With	great	skill	and	dexterity,	he	balanced	himself	and	started	making
his	journey	homeward.

Taking	a	shortcut	through	a	park,	he	fell	headlong	into	a	rosebush.	His	face	became	a	mess.
He	gathered	himself	and	started	making	his	way	again.	In	this	condition,	he	reached	home,
and	tried	to	find	the	keyhole.	But	those	wretched	keyholes	nowadays	are	made	so	small!	That
took	another	twenty	minutes.

He	finally	got	in	and	stumbled	into	the	bedroom.	Fortunately,	the	wife	was	a	big	sleeper.	He
went	into	the	bathroom,	looked	at	himself	in	the	mirror.	His	face	was	a	real	mess.	He	opened
the	medicine	cabinet,	took	out	some	medicine	and	a	box	of	Band-Aids	and	fixed	himself,
whichever	way	he	could.	Then	he	crawled	quietly	into	bed.

Next	morning,	his	wife	threw	a	bucket	of	cold	water	on	his	face.
He	woke	up	gasping,	feeling	water-boarded.	He	said,	“Why,	why?	It’s	only	a	Sunday!”
She	said,	“You	fool!	Once	again	drinking?”
“No,	honey,	I	promised	you	six	months	ago.	Since	then,	I	haven’t	touched	a	drop.”
She	held	him	by	the	shirt,	dragged	him	into	the	bathroom,	and	showed	him:	the	Band-Aids
were	all	over	the	mirror!

When	pain,	misery,	or	anger	happen,	it	is	time	to	look	within	you,	not	around	you.	To
achieve	well-being	the	only	one	who	needs	to	be	fixed	is	 _you_ .	What	you	forget	is	that	when
you	are	sick,	it	is	 _you_ 	who	needs	the	medication.	When	you	are	hungry,	it	is	 _you_ 	who	needs	the
food.	The	only	one	that	needs	to	be	fixed	is	you,	but	just	to	understand	this	simple	fact	people
take	lifetimes!

Creating	your	own	destiny	does	not	mean	you	have	to	control	every	situation	in	the	world.
Creating	your	destiny	is	about	steadily	heading	toward	your	well-being	and	your	ultimate
nature,	no	matter	what	the	content	of	life	is	around	you.	It	simply	means	making	yourself	in
such	a	way	that,	whatever	the	events	and	situations	around	you,	you	don’t	get	crushed	by	them;
_you	ride	them_.

The	spiritual	process	is	not	about	imposing	your	ideas	on	existence;	it	is	about	making
yourself	in	such	a	way	that	the	creation	and	the	Creator,	and	every	atom	in	this	existence,
cannot	help	yielding	to	you.	When	you	pursue	your	own	likes	and	dislikes,	you	feel	alone	in
this	 vast	 existence,	 constantly	 insecure,	 unstable,	 psychologically	 challenged.	 But	 once
existence	yields	to	you,	it	delivers	you	to	a	different	place	of	grace—where	every	pebble,
every	 rock,	 every	 tree,	 every	 atom,	 speaks	 to	 you	 in	 a	 language	 you	 understand.	 Every


moment	there	 are	a	 million	 miracles	happening	 around	you:	 a	 flower	blossoming,	 a	 bird
tweeting,	a	bee	humming,	a	raindrop	falling,	a	snowflake	wafting	along	the	clear	evening	air.
There	is	magic	everywhere.	If	you	learn	how	to	live	it,	life	is	nothing	short	of	a	daily	miracle.

It	doesn’t	matter	who	you	are,	life	doesn’t	work	for	you	unless	you	do	the	right	things.	You
may	consider	yourself	a	good	person,	but	if	you	don’t	water	your	garden,	will	it	flower?	You
need	to	do	the	right	things	if	you	want	results.	Judgments	about	good	and	bad	are	essentially
human	 and	 socially	 conditioned.	 These	 are	 fine	 as	 social	 norms.	 But	 existence	 is	 not
concerned	with	these	conclusions.	Existence	is	not	judgmental.	It	treats	all	of	us	the	same	way.

One	winter	morning	in	Michigan,	an	old-timer	went	ice-fishing.	It	was	ten	o’clock	in	the
morning.	He	cut	a	small	hole	in	the	ice	and	sat	down	with	a	crate	of	beer	beside	him.	Fishing
is	not	just	about	the	catch;	it	is	a	patience	game.	He	knew	that.	He	put	the	line	in.	One	by	one,
the	beer	cans	started	emptying	out.	The	fishing	basket	also	stayed	empty.

The	day	drew	on.	At	four	o’clock	in	the	afternoon,	his	basket	was	still	empty.	So	was	his
crate	of	beer.

A	young	boy	came	along.	He	was	carrying	a	big	boom	box	that	played	deafening	heavy
metal	music.	He	cut	a	hole	in	the	ice	nearby,	and	sat	down	to	fish,	his	music	still	blaring.

The	 old-timer	 glanced	 at	 him	 with	 ill-disguised	 contempt.	 “I’ve	 been	 sitting	 here	 since
morning	 quietly,	 with	 not	 a	 single	 fish,	 and	 the	 fool	 thinks	 he	 can	 catch	 fish	 with	 music
blaring,	at	four	in	the	afternoon!	No	fool	like	a	young	fool!”

To	his	amazement,	within	ten	minutes,	the	boy	landed	a	huge	trout!	The	old	man	dismissed
it	as	a	lucky	break	and	continued	fishing.	Ten	minutes	later	the	boy	caught	one	more	big	trout.

Now	the	old	man	could	ignore	it	no	longer.	He	stared	at	the	boy,	dumbfounded.	And	just
then,	to	his	utter	disbelief,	the	boy	landed	one	more	huge	trout.

The	old-timer	cast	his	pride	aside	and	walked	slowly	over	to	the	boy.	“What	is	the	secret?”
he	asked.	“I’ve	been	sitting	here	the	whole	day	and	my	basket	is	empty.	You	already	have	three
huge	trout.	What’s	going	on?”

The	boy	said,	“Ru	ra	ra	ra	ru	ra	rum.”
The	old	man	put	his	hand	to	his	ear	and	asked,	“What?”
The	boy	turned	down	the	stereo	and	said,	“Ru	ra	ra	ra	ru	ra	rum.”
The	old	man	was	perplexed.	“I	don’t	understand	a	word	you’re	saying.”
The	boy	spat	a	blob	of	something	into	his	hand	and	said,	“You	have	to	keep	the	worms
warm.”

Unless	 you	 do	 the	 right	 things,	 the	 right	 things	 will	 not	 happen	 to	 you.	 Principles	 and
philosophies	are	only	of	social	consequence.	It	is	time	to	wake	up	to	yourself	as	an	existential
being,	a	living	being,	rather	than	a	psychological	case.	Then	your	destiny	will	be	your	own.
One	hundred	percent	your	own.


This	is	not	an	idle	promise.	It	is	a	guarantee.


Once	 it	 happened...An	 argument	 arose	 one	 evening	 between	 a	 husband	 and	 wife.	 The
argument	was	over	the	burning	question:	who	should	close	the	front	door	today?

Not	a	simple	question.	And	not	a	laughing	matter.	These	are	very	serious	issues	in	domestic
situations.	Who	should	close	the	door	today,	who	should	switch	off	the	garden	lights	this
evening,	who	should	take	the	dog	for	a	walk—these	are	questions	that	can	drive	couples	to
divorce.

The	argument	grew	more	and	more	heated.	The	wife	decided,	“Every	day,	it	is	I	who	in	the
end	 accepts	 defeat.	 Today,	 I	 am	 not	 going	 to	 give	 in.”	 The	 husband	 also	 grew	 equally
determined.	“She	pushes	me	around	all	the	time.	I	am	not	going	to	give	in	to	this	woman
today,	no	matter	what.”

It	was	one	of	those	grand	rows.	Now,	every	home	has	its	own	system	of	resolving	these
arguments.	In	this	family,	when	confronted	by	an	impasse,	both	husband	and	wife	would	sit
silently;	the	person	who	uttered	the	first	word	would	have	to	go	and	close	the	door.

The	two	sat	in	stony	silence.	Minutes	ticked	on	into	hours.	Dinner	was	on	the	table.	If	the
husband	said	he	wanted	to	eat,	he	would	have	to	close	the	door.	If	the	wife	proposed	dinner,
she	would	have	to	close	the	door.

Midnight.	They	were	still	sitting.	A	few	rogues	were	passing	by	on	the	street.	They	saw	the
doors	of	the	house	open,	lights	on,	no	party,	nothing.	Everything	was	quiet.	They	wanted	to
see	what	was	going	on,	so	they	looked	into	the	sitting	room.	They	saw	two	people	sitting
there,	steadfastly	silent.

The	rogues	looked	at	the	silent	couple.	They	were	a	little	surprised.	They	decided	to	take	a
chance.	They	helped	themselves	to	a	few	valuables	in	the	sitting	room.	The	two	people	said
nothing.	 The	 rogues	 grew	 amused.	 Emboldened,	 they	 sat	 at	 the	 dining	 table	 and	 served
themselves	dinner.	The	couple	sat	heroically	silent.

The	rogues	were	hugely	tickled.	What	the	hell	was	happening	here?	They	grew	bolder	still.
One	of	them	kissed	the	wife.	Still,	the	couple	didn’t	utter	a	word.	The	one	who	spoke	would
have	to	close	the	door.	The	stakes	were	too	high.	Neither	could	risk	it.

Now	the	rogues	got	a	bit	spooked.	They	decided	it	was	time	to	leave	this	strange	household.
But	before	they	left,	they	wanted	to	leave	their	mark.	They	decided	to	shave	off	the	husband’s
moustache.	One	of	them	approached	him,	razor	in	hand.


Then	the	husband	finally	spoke.	He	said,	“Okay,	damn	it,	I’ll	close	the	door!”
Perhaps	the	scenarios	are	different,	but	are	there	not	situations	in	your	life	that	hinge	on	a
similar	question:	who’s	responsible?

Who	 _is_ 	responsible?
It’s	a	big	question.	Let’s	put	the	question	more	precisely:	who	is	responsible	for	the	way
you	are	right	now?

Your	genes?	Your	father?	Your	mother?	Your	wife?	Your	husband?	Your	teacher?	Your
boss?	Your	mother-in-law?	God?	The	government?	All	of	the	above?

The	condition	is	a	pervasive	one.	Ask	someone,	“Why	are	you	in	this	situation?”	Pat	comes
the	response,	“You	know,	when	I	was	a	child,	my	parents...”	The	same	old	story,	with	just	a
few	variations.

There	is	an	ancient	science	of	how	to	create	misery,	and	one	in	which	human	beings	need
no	encouragement	whatsoever.	There	is	almost	no	one	who	is	not	an	expert.	Passing	the	buck
is	what	you	do	in	a	hundred	different	ways	each	day.	You	have	collectively	refined	the	old
blame	game	into	a	fine	art.

The	 quality	 of	 our	 lives	 is	 determined	 by	 our	 ability	 to	 respond	 to	 the	 varied	 complex
situations	 that	 we	 encounter.	 If	 the	 ability	 to	 respond	 with	 intelligence,	 competence,	 and
sensitivity	is	compromised	by	a	compulsive	or	reactive	approach,	we	are	enslaved	by	the
situation.	It	means	we	have	allowed	the	nature	of	our	life	experience	to	be	determined	by	our
circumstances,	not	by	us.

Being	fully	responsible	is	to	be	fully	conscious.	What	you	consider	to	be	your	body	is	what
you	have	gathered	through	ingestion.	What	you	consider	to	be	your	mind	is	what	you	have
gathered	through	the	five	senses.	What	is	beyond	that—which	you	did	not	gather—is	who	you
_are_ .	Being	alive	is	being	conscious.	Everybody	is	conscious	to	some	degree,	but	when	you
touch	the	dimension	beyond	body	and	beyond	mind,	you	have	touched	that	which	is	the	very
source	of	consciousness.	You	realize	then	that	the	entire	universe	is	conscious.	You	inhabit	a
living	cosmos.

The	 physical	 and	 psychological	 dimensions	 belong	 to	 the	 realm	 of	 polarities—pain-
pleasure,	love-hate,	masculine-feminine,	and	so	on.	If	you	have	one,	the	other	is	bound	to
follow.	But	when	you	move	into	the	fundamental	dimension	of	who	you	are,	you	are	beyond
all	polarities.	You	now	become	blissful	by	your	own	nature.	You	are	the	master	of	your	own
destiny.

It	is	time	to	reclaim	for	ourselves	the	extraordinary	transformative	power	of	this	single
word:	 _responsibility_ .	Apply	it	to	your	life,	and	watch	the	magic	unfold.

Let	us	settle	what	we	mean	by	the	word,	at	the	start.	“Responsibility”	is	a	much	misunderstood
term.	It	has	been	used	so	widely	and	indiscriminately	that	it	has	lost	much	of	its	inner	voltage.


Responsibility	does	not	mean	taking	on	the	burdens	of	the	world.	It	does	not	mean	accepting
blame	for	things	you	have	done	or	not	done.	It	does	not	mean	living	in	a	state	of	perpetual
guilt.

Responsibility	simply	means	your	 _ability	to	respond_ .	If	you	decide,	“I	am	responsible,”	you
will	have	the	ability	to	respond.	If	you	decide,	“I	am	not	responsible,”	you	will	not	have	the
ability	to	respond.	It	is	as	simple	as	that.	All	it	requires	is	for	you	to	realize	that	you	are
responsible	for	all	that	you	are	and	all	that	you	are	not,	all	that	may	happen	to	you	and	all	that
may	not	happen	to	you.

This	is	 not	 a	 mind	 game.	 This	 is	 not	a	 self-help	 strategy	 for	 easy	 living.	 This	 is	 not	 a
philosophical	theory.	This	is	a	reality.	Your	physical	existence	is	possible	only	because	of
your	 body’s	 seamless	 ability	 to	 respond	 to	 the	 entire	 universe.	 If	 your	 body	 wasn’t
responding,	you	wouldn’t	be	able	to	exist	for	a	moment.	Do	you	see	that?

What	the	trees	around	you	are	exhaling,	you	are	inhaling	right	now;	what	you	are	exhaling,
the	 trees	 are	 inhaling	 at	 this	 very	 moment.	 This	 transaction	 is	 ongoing.	 Whether	 you	 are
aware	of	it	or	not,	one	half	of	your	pulmonary	system	is	hanging	up	there	right	now	on	a	tree!
You	have	never	experienced	this	interdependence;	you	have	probably,	at	the	most,	thought
about	it	intellectually.	But	if	you	had	experienced	this	connection,	would	anyone	have	to	tell
you,	“Plant	trees,	protect	the	forests,	save	the	world”?	Would	it	even	be	necessary?

Taking	responsibility	is	not	a	convenient	philosophy	to	reconcile	you	to	the	way	things	are.
It	is	simply	waking	up	to	reality.	This	ability	to	respond	to	the	entire	universe	is	already	a
physical	reality.	It	is	only	your	thoughts	and	emotions	that	need	to	become	conscious	of	the
fact.

Suppose	something	goes	wrong	in	your	office.	Perhaps	you	think	it	was	due	to	a	particular
colleague’s	ineptitude.	You	could	haul	her	up,	lose	your	temper,	fire	her.	Your	blood	pressure
is	 likely	 to	 rise;	 the	 office	 atmosphere	 will	 be	 vitiated;	 the	 aftereffects	 of	 your	 rage	 will
probably	be	felt	by	you	and	your	fellow	workers	for	days	and	weeks	after	the	incident;	you
will	 probably	 have	 to	 work	 particularly	 hard	 at	 restoring	 the	 peace	 and	 reestablishing	 a
situation	of	mutual	trust.

There	 is	 another	 choice.	 You	 could	 simply	 see	 the	 situation	 the	 way	 it	 is	 and	 take
responsibility	for	it.	Taking	responsibility	is	not	accepting	blame	instead	of	assigning	it.	It
simply	means	consciously	responding	to	the	situation.	Once	you	take	responsibility,	you	will
invariably	start	exploring	ways	to	address	the	situation.	You	will	look	for	solutions.

If	 you	 are	 frequently	 in	 this	 mode,	 your	 ability	 to	 craft	 your	 life	 situations	 will	 keep
enhancing	 itself.	 With	 this	 enhanced	 competence	 to	 deal	 with	 life	 and	 its	 multiple
complexities,	you	begin	to	rise	to	positions	of	possibility	and	power.	If	you	assume	absolute
responsibility	within	yourself	for	all	that	is	around	you,	you	will	become	the	center	of	any
situation	 at	 home,	 work,	 or	 even	 the	 universe.	 Since	 you	 become	 indispensable	 to	 these
situations,	there	is	no	sense	of	insecurity	or	incompleteness	within	you	anymore.

Only	if	you	realize	you	are	responsible	do	you	have	the	freedom	to	create	yourself	the	way
you	want	to	be,	not	as	a	reaction	to	the	situations	in	which	you	exist.	 _Reactivity	is	enslavement.
Responsibility	 is	 freedom._ 	When	you	are	able	to	create	yourself	the	way	you	want,	you	can


create	your	life	the	way	you	want	as	well.	Your	outer	life	may	not	be	a	hundred	percent	in
your	control,	but	your	inner	life	always	will.

On	the	other	hand,	the	first	reaction—anger—usually	provokes	unintelligent	action.	Anger
is	fundamentally	self-defeating.	If	you	look	at	your	life	closely,	you	will	find	that	you	have
done	the	most	idiotic	and	life-negative	things	when	you	were	angry.	Above	all,	you	were
working	against	yourself.	If	you	work	against	yourself,	if	you	sabotage	your	own	well-being,
you	are	obviously	choosing	unintelligence	as	a	way	of	life.

I	am	not	propounding	a	moral	argument	here.	I	am	not	telling	you	that	you	should	not	lose
your	temper	because	it	is	ethically	wrong.	If	anger	is	a	pleasant	experience,	blow	your	top.
What’s	the	problem?	The	point	is	it	is	singularly	unpleasant—for	you	and	for	those	at	the
receiving	end.	It	is	also	counterproductive	and	therefore	inefficient.

I	am	not	offering	a	rage-control	or	anger	management	strategy	either.	When	I	first	came	to
the	United	States,	I	heard	everybody	talking	about	“stress	management.”	It	puzzled	me.	Why
would	 anybody	 want	 to	 _manage_ stress?	 I	 always	 thought	 we	 managed	 the	 things	 that	 are
precious	to	us—our	money,	our	business,	our	family.	It	took	me	time	to	see	that	people	have
assumed	that	stress	is	an	inevitable	part	of	their	lives!	They	do	not	see	that	it	is	entirely	self-
created	and	self-inflicted.	Once	you	take	charge	of	your	inner	life,	 _there	 is	 no	 such	 thing	 as
stress_.

The	point	is	that	anger	is	rooted	in	your	false	perception	that	you	can	change	the	situation
by	 losing	 your	 temper	 with	 it.	 But	 your	 life	 experience	 tells	 you	 time	 and	 again	 that	 the
reverse	is	true,	that	you	can	never	change	any	situation	for	the	better	by	forsaking	your	sense
and	intelligence.	You	only	mess	up	your	situations	by	getting	angry.	Once	you	see	that	clearly,
you’ve	taken	the	first	step	toward	change.

Besides,	there	is	substantial	medical	and	scientific	evidence	to	prove	that	in	a	state	of	anger,
you	are	literally	poisoning	your	system.	This	can	be	verified	with	something	as	simple	as	a
blood	test.	When	you	are	angry,	your	very	chemistry	is	altered,	and	your	system	turns	toxic.
Intense	activity	and	sleep	are	times	when	this	chemical	mess	can	undo	itself.	But	if	you	are	in
frequent	states	of	rage,	you	are	heading	toward	physical	and	psychological	disaster.	There	is
no	doubt	about	this.

There	is	a	commonly	held	belief	that	rage	produces	results;	that	nothing	happens	in	the
world	without	the	adrenaline	rush	of	anger.	The	iconic	figure	of	the	Cuban	revolution,	Che
Guevara,	 famously	 said,	 “If	 you	 tremble	 with	 indignation	 at	 every	 injustice,	 you	 are	 a
comrade	of	mine.”	Perhaps	that	is	true.	But	 _in_ 	rage,	you	become	one	with	a	group;	 _out_ 	of
rage,	you	become	one	with	the	universe.

Once	it	happened...A	gentleman	carrying	an	infant	was	traveling	from	London	to	Bristol	on	a
train.	Another	gentleman	entered	the	compartment,	dumped	his	two	huge	suitcases,	and	sat
beside	the	first.


As	you	know,	Englishmen	don’t	immediately	speak	to	each	other.	So,	the	first	gentleman
waited	very	politely	for	a	while.	Then	he	turned	to	the	second	passenger	and	said,	“Looking	at
your	suitcases,	I	presume	you	are	a	salesperson?	I	am	also	one.”

The	gentleman	said,	“Yes,	I	am	a	salesman.”
Another	genteel	pause.	Then	the	first	passenger	asked,	“What	do	you	sell?”
The	other	replied,	“I	sell	helical	gears.”	Another	decorous	silence.	Then	he	asked	the	first
gentleman,	“And	what	do	 _you_ 	sell?”

He	said,	“I	sell	condoms.”
Shocked,	the	second	gentleman	said,	“You	sell	condoms	and	you	are	taking	your	son	with
you	on	your	business?	Is	that	appropriate?”

“This	is	not	my	son,”	replied	the	first	passenger.	“It’s	a	complaint	from	Bristol.”
Human	beings	are	in	a	perennial	state	of	complaint.	They	carry	their	complaints	with	them
like	a	badge	of	their	identity.	There	are	many	who	live	their	lives	lamenting	that	life	has	been
particularly	unfair	to	them.	They	cite	instances	of	all	the	terrible	things	that	have	befallen
them,	the	chances	they	never	got,	the	many	injustices	they	have	suffered.	Maybe	it	is	even	true.

What	 most	 people	 forget	 is	 that	 the	 past	 exists	 within	 each	 one	 of	 us	 _only	 as	 memory_.
Memory	has	no	objective	existence.	It	is	not	existential;	it	is	purely	psychological.	If	you
retain	your	ability	to	respond,	your	memory	of	the	past	will	become	an	empowering	process.
But	if	you	are	in	a	compulsive	cycle	of	reactivity,	memory	distorts	your	perception	of	the
present,	and	your	thoughts,	emotions,	and	actions	become	disproportionate	to	the	stimulus.

The	 choice	 is	 always	 before	 you:	 to	 _respond	 consciously_ to	 the	 present;	 or	 to	 _react
compulsively_ 	to	it.	There	is	a	vast	difference	between	the	two.	And	it	can	make	the	world	of	a
difference.

If	terrible	things	have	happened	to	you,	you	ought	to	have	grown	wise.	If	the	worst	possible
events	have	befallen	you,	you	should	be	the	wisest	of	the	lot.	But	instead	of	growing	wise,
most	people	become	wounded.	In	a	state	of	conscious	response,	it	is	possible	to	use	every	life
situation—however	ugly—as	an	opportunity	for	growth.	But	if	you	habitually	think,	“I	am	the
way	I	am	because	of	someone	else,”	you	are	using	life	situations	merely	as	an	opportunity	for
self-destruction	or	stagnation.

I	 once	 heard	 a	 moving	 account	 of	 a	 woman	 who	 used	 one	 of	 the	 most	 horrific	 life
situations	to	transform	herself	into	a	beautiful	being.	In	the	beginning	of	the	Second	World
War,	 a	 bunch	 of	 Nazi	 soldiers	 broke	 into	 a	 house	 in	 Austria.	 They	 took	 the	 adults	 away
separately,	and	the	two	children—a	thirteen-year-old	girl	and	an	eight-year-old	boy—were
taken	to	a	railway	station.	As	they	waited	along	with	other	children	for	the	train	to	arrive,	the
boys	started	a	game.	Oblivious	to	what	lay	in	store,	they	started	playing,	as	children	are	wont
to	do.

A	cargo	train	arrived	and	the	soldiers	started	packing	everyone	into	it.	Once	they	were	in,
the	little	girl	noticed	that	her	brother	had	forgotten	to	bring	his	shoes.	It	was	an	Austrian
winter,	a	bitter	one.	Without	shoes,	you	could	lose	your	feet.	The	girl	lost	her	temper.	She
shook	her	kid	brother,	boxed	his	ears,	and	abused	him.	“You	idiot!	Don’t	we	have	enough


trouble	on	our	hands?	We	don’t	know	where	our	parents	are,	we	don’t	know	where	we’re
going!	And	now	you	go	and	lose	your	shoes?	What	am	I	supposed	to	do	with	you?”

At	the	next	station,	the	boys	and	girls	were	separated.	And	that	is	the	last	that	the	brother	and
sister	ever	saw	of	each	other.

About	 three	 and	 a	 half	 years	 later,	 the	 girl	 came	 out	 of	 the	 concentration	 camp.	 She
discovered	she	was	the	only	one	alive	in	her	family.	Everyone	else	had	vanished,	including
her	brother.	All	that	remained	was	the	memory	of	the	harsh	words	she	had	uttered	the	last	time
she	had	seen	him	alive.

That	was	when	she	made	a	life-changing	decision:	“It	doesn’t	matter	who	I	meet,	I	will
never	speak	to	them	in	a	manner	that	I	regret	later,	because	this	meeting	could	be	my	last.”	She
could	have	spent	her	life	in	defeat	and	remorse,	but	she	made	this	simple	decision,	which
transformed	her	life	phenomenally.	She	went	on	to	live	a	rich	and	fulfilled	life.

The	 most	 horrific	 things	 in	 life	 can	 be	 a	 source	 of	 nourishment	 if	 you	 accept,	 “I	 am
responsible	for	the	way	I	am	now.”	It	is	possible	to	transform	the	greatest	adversity	into	a
stepping-stone	for	personal	growth.	If	you	take	one	hundred	percent	responsibility	for	the
way	you	are	now,	a	brighter	tomorrow	is	a	possibility.	But	if	you	take	no	responsibility	for
the	 present—if	 you	 blame	 your	 parents,	 your	 friend,	 your	 husband,	 your	 girlfriend,	 your
colleagues	for	the	way	you	are—you	have	forsaken	your	future	even	before	it	comes.

You	come	into	this	world	with	nothing	and	you	go	empty-handed.	The	wealth	of	life	lies
only	 in	 how	 you	 have	 allowed	 its	 experiences	 to	 enrich	 you.	 Filth	 can	 blossom	 into	 the
fragrance	 of	 a	 flower.	 Manure	 can	 transform	 itself	 into	 the	 sweetness	 of	 a	 mango.	 No
adversity	is	an	impediment	if	you	are	in	a	state	of	conscious	response.	No	matter	what	the
nature	of	the	situation	you	are	in,	it	can	only	enhance	your	experience	of	life,	if	you	allow	it
to.

Resentment,	 anger,	 jealousy,	 pain,	 hurt,	 and	 depression	 are	 poisons	 that	 _you_ drink	 but
expect	 someone	 else	 to	 die.	 Life	 does	 not	 work	 that	 way.	 Most	 people	 take	 lifetimes	 to
understand	this	simple	truth.

Now	that	we	have	established	what	responsibility	is,	it	is	time	to	look	at	what	it	is	not.	Let	us
start	by	clearing	up	a	few	fundamental	misconceptions.

For	one,	many	believe	that	taking	responsibility	compromises	their	freedom.	This	seems	to
be	logically	true,	on	a	simplistic	level.	Existentially,	it	is	completely	off	the	mark.

Let	 us	 consider	 a	 concrete	 scenario.	 Your	 pen	 falls	 off	 a	 table.	 If	 you	 see	 you	 are
responsible	for	it,	you	have	several	choices	before	you.	You	could	simply	bend	down	and
pick	it	up.	If	you	are	unable	to	do	that,	you	could	ask	someone	to	help.	Or	if	you	aren’t
inclined	to	act	on	it	right	now,	you	might	pick	it	up	later.	You	have	a	variety	of	options.

```
If,	on	the	other	hand,	you	don’t	take	responsibility	for	it,	what	can	you	do?	Nothing.
```

Which	is	freedom?	To	have	choices	or	to	have	none?
Your	logical	mind	tells	you,	“Give	up	all	responsibility	and	you	will	be	free.”	But	in	your
experience	of	life,	the	more	you	are	able	to	respond	to	everything	around	you,	the	freer	you
are!	 The	 logical	 and	 experiential	 dimensions	 of	 life	 work	 in	 diametrically	 opposite	 ways.
Logic	is	not	without	its	uses,	but	these	help	only	to	handle	the	material	aspects	of	life.	If	you
handle	your	entire	life	with	logic	alone,	you	will	end	up	a	mess.

Secondly,	people	often	confuse	responsibility	with	reaction.	We	have	already	demonstrated
earlier	that	there	is	a	world	of	difference	between	the	two.	The	first	is	born	in	awareness,	the
second	in	unawareness.	The	first	is	born	in	consciousness,	the	second	in	unconsciousness.
The	first	is	freedom,	the	second	enslavement.

It	is	time	to	make	yet	another	distinction.	Responsibility	is	not	reaction	but	 _it	is	 not	action_
either.

Responsibility	and	action	belong	to	different	dimensions.	The	ability	to	respond	gives	you
the	freedom	to	act.	It	also	gives	you	the	freedom	not	to	act.	It	puts	you	in	the	driver’s	seat	of
your	life.	It	empowers	you	to	decide	the	nature	and	volume	of	action	you	want	to	undertake.
Responsibility	is	not	compulsive	action;	it	offers	you	the	 _choice	of	action_.

Can	you	act	upon	everything	in	the	world	today?	No,	but	you	can	respond	to	everything	in
the	world	today.	Action	has	to	be	judiciously	performed,	depending	on	a	careful	analysis	of
resources—strength,	capability,	energy,	age,	situation.	Your	ability	to	act	is	always	limited,
but	there	are	no	limitations	on	your	ability	to	respond.	If	you	are	willing,	you	can	respond	to
just	about	anything.

Just	because	you	are	responsible	for	your	children,	are	you	able	to	do	everything	for	them?
If	you	did	everything	for	them,	you	would	mess	up	their	lives.	Your	sense	of	responsibility
makes	you	do	certain	things	for	them	and	not	do	others.	So,	responsibility	does	not	mean
unbridled	action.	Far	from	it.

How,	you	may	ask,	are	you	responsible	for	the	violence	and	injustice	in	the	world?	How
are	you	responsible	for	the	war	and	the	bloodshed,	the	atrocities	against	the	marginal	and	the
underprivileged,	all	over	the	world?	Certainly	you	are	not	to	blame	for	any	of	it.	But	the
moment	you	become	conscious	of	any	of	these	events,	you	do	respond—either	in	concern,
love,	care,	hate,	anger,	indignation,	or	even	action.	It	is	just	that	this	is	often	an	unconscious
reaction	rather	than	a	conscious	response.	If	you	make	this	ability	to	respond	into	a	willing
process,	that	marks	the	birth	of	a	tremendous	new	possibility	within	you.	Your	inner	genius
begins	to	flower.

Can	you	then	respond	to	the	moon?	You	can.	Your	body	and	life	energies	certainly	do.
When	entire	oceans	rise	in	response	to	the	cycles	of	the	moon,	do	you	think	the	water	content
in	your	own	system	doesn’t	rise	as	well?	Maybe	you	aren’t	an	astronaut;	maybe	you	can	never
walk	on	the	moon.	But	you	can	respond	to	the	moon.	In	fact,	you	already	do.	You	can	just
choose	to	do	it—willingly,	consciously.

And	that	brings	us	to	the	fourth	misconception.	Many	think	responsibility	means	capability.
Wrong	again.	When	it	comes	to	action,	capability	could	play	a	role.	But	when	it	comes	to
response,	it	is	just	a	question	of	willingness.


If	you	see	someone	dying	on	the	street,	are	you	responsible?
If	you	are	willing	to	respond,	you	will	explore	various	options.	If	you	are	a	doctor,	you
will	try	direct	intervention.	If	you	are	not,	you	may	call	911.	Or	if	all	this	is	being	done	by
someone	else,	you	will	at	least	have	concern	in	your	heart.	But	if	you	are	not	responsible,	you
will	just	sit	there	like	a	stone	watching	someone	die	before	your	eyes.

Your	ability	to	respond	is	the	way	you	 _are_ .	Only	your	ability	to	act	is	connected	with	the
outside	world.	Responsibility	is	not	about	talking,	thinking,	or	doing.	Responsibility	is	about
_being_ .	 That’s	 the	 way	 life	 is—not	 an	 independent,	 self-contained	 bubble	 but	 a	 moment-to-
moment	dialogue	with	the	universe.	You	don’t	have	to	work	at	making	it	that	way.	You	just
have	to	see	it	the	way	it	is.

Let	 us	 deepen	 the	 exploration.	 If	 responsibility	 is	 “response-ability,”	 the	 capacity	 to	 be
responsive	to	situations,	let	me	ask	you	another	question:	is	your	ability	to	respond	limited	or
limitless?

Are	you	capable	of	responding	to	a	plant?
You	are.
To	a	stranger	on	the	street?
You	are.
To	the	moon?
You	are.
To	the	sun,	to	the	stars?
You	are.
To	the	whole	cosmos?
You	are.
In	fact,	as	we	have	seen,	every	subatomic	particle	in	your	body	is	responding	in	a	limitless
way	 to	 the	 great	 dance	 of	 energies	 that	 is	 the	 cosmos.	 The	 only	 reason	 you	 are	 not
experiencing	the	life	process	in	all	its	majesty	and	profundity	is	your	current	state	of	mental
resistance.	Your	psychological	structure	is	a	stone	wall.	If	you	are	willing,	every	moment	of
your	 life	 can	 be	 a	 fantastic	 experience.	 Just	 the	 act	 of	 inhaling	 and	 exhaling	 can	 be	 a
tremendous	love	affair.

Why	is	the	mind	resisting	this?
Because	it	is	crippled	by	its	own	limited	logic	which	says,	“Taking	responsibility	for	just
two	people	already	gives	me	a	headache.	If	I	take	responsibility	for	the	whole	world	what	will
happen?	I’ll	crack	up!”

Through	millions	of	years	of	evolution,	nature	has	caged	you	within	certain	boundaries—
this	is	the	human	predicament.	But	this	imprisonment	is	only	on	the	level	of	biology.	On	the


level	of	human	consciousness,	you	are	like	a	bird	in	a	cage	without	a	door.	What	a	tragic
irony!	It	is	only	out	of	long	aeons	of	habit	that	you	are	refusing	to	fly	free.

Life	has	left	everything	open	for	you.	Existence	has	not	blocked	anything	for	anyone.	If	you
are	willing,	you	can	access	the	whole	universe.	Someone	said,	“Knock	and	it	shall	open.”	You
don’t	even	have	to	knock,	because	there	 _is_ 	no	door.	It	is	open.	You	just	have	to	walk	through,
that’s	all.

This	is	the	sole	purpose	of	the	spiritual	process.	The	life	and	work	of	every	spiritual	guide,
across	history	and	across	culture,	has	been	just	this:	to	point	out	that	the	cage	door	does	not
exist.	 Whether	 you	 fly	 or	 choose	 to	 remain	 in	 the	 limitations	 of	 the	 cage—let	 that	 be	 a
conscious	choice.

The	possibility	of	ultimate	freedom	may	seem	deeply	threatening	to	many.	Yes,	it	is	a	threat
—but	only	to	your	limitations.	Do	you	want	to	live	a	life	of	voluntary	self-imprisonment?
Limiting	 your	 responsibility	 is	 to	 suffocate	 yourself	 on	 various	 levels—physically,
intellectually,	and	emotionally.	Unfortunately,	this	stifling	of	life	is	understood	by	people	as
safety,	as	security.

Take	the	case	of	a	seed.	If	the	seed	constantly	tries	to	save	itself,	a	new	life	is	impossible.
The	seed	goes	through	the	tremendous	struggle	of	losing	what	it	believes	is	its	identity—
losing	 its	 safety	 and	 integrity	 and	 becoming	 vulnerable—in	 order	 to	 grow	 into	 a	 many-
branched	leafy	tree,	abundant	in	fruit	and	flower.	But	without	that	vulnerability,	that	voluntary
openness	to	transformation,	life	won’t	sprout.

One	of	the	biggest	problems	in	the	world	today	is	loneliness.	It	is	quite	incredible.	The
planet	is	teeming	with	seven	billion	people,	but	people	are	lonely!	If	someone	enjoys	being
alone,	there	is	no	problem	at	all.	But	most	people	are	suffering	because	of	it!	They	are	going
through	serious	psychological	problems	as	a	consequence.	If	you	are	lonely,	it	is	because	you
have	 chosen	 to	 become	 an	 island	 unto	 yourself.	 It	 doesn’t	 have	 to	 be	 this	 way.	 “I	 am	 not
responsible”	makes	you	unwilling	to	get	along	with	anyone—until	you	can’t	even	get	along
with	yourself.	It	often	comes	to	a	point	when	you	believe	you	are	not	even	responsible	for
what	is	happening	within	yourself!

What	the	mind	forgets	is	that	the	ability	to	respond	is	 _the	 basis	 of	 life_ .	 If	 the	 ability	 is
acknowledged	 willingly,	 you	 become	 blissful.	 If	 it	 happens	 unwillingly,	 you	 become
miserable.

Being	responsible	is	taking	ownership	of	your	life.	It	means	you	have	taken	the	first	radical
step	 to	 becoming	 a	 complete	 human	 being—fully	 conscious	 and	 fully	 human.	 In	 taking
responsibility	and	beginning	the	journey	toward	conscious	living,	you	are	putting	an	end	to
the	age-old	patterns	of	assigning	blame	outward	or	heavenward.	You	have	begun	the	greatest
adventure	life	has	to	offer:	the	voyage	inward.

This	 notion	 of	 responsibility,	 as	 you	 might	 have	 noticed,	 seems	 to	 lead	 us	 seamlessly	 to


another	word,	remarkably	similar	in	its	implications.	A	word	we	know	well.	Perhaps	much
too	well.	A	much-used,	much-abused	four-letter	word.

Love.
You	know	the	teachings,	of	course.	All	over	the	world,	people	have	been	told	that	love	is
the	ultimate,	love	is	supreme,	love	is	divine,	that	we	must	love	our	neighbors,	and	so	on.	All
wonderful	teachings.	But	when	you	 _try_ 	to	become	loving,	it	is	difficult	and	often	ends	up
seeming	pretentious.	Have	you	noticed	this?	It	seems	easier	to	not	love	at	all	than	to	try	to
become	loving!

But	to	be	loving	is	simply	this:	a	willingness	to	respond	freely	and	openly.	Right	now,	it
may	be	limited	to	one	or	two	people	in	your	lives.	But	it	is	possible	to	extend	this	ability	to
embrace	the	entire	world.

Does	it	mean	going	out	into	the	streets	and	hugging	everyone?	No.	That	would	be	crazy—
not	to	mention,	irresponsible.	As	we	have	said,	responsibility	is	not	about	action,	but	a	way	of
being.	 _Love	is	not	something	you	do;	it	is	just	the	way	you	are._

Right	now,	you	have	left	one	window	in	your	life	open—for	a	few	people.	You	did	that
because	somewhere	you	understood	that	if	you	closed	that	window,	you’d	go	mad.	Your	only
options	would	be	insanity	or	suicide.	But	there	is	another	way	to	approach	this.	Does	it	mean
opening	another	window?	Or	opening	a	door?

Here’s	a	more	effective	option:	why	don’t	you	just	demolish	the	wall?
Love	 has	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 someone	 else.	 It	 is	 all	 about	 _you_ .	 It	 is	 a	 way	 of	 being.	 It
essentially	means	you	have	brought	sweetness	into	your	emotion.	If	a	loved	one	travels	to
another	country,	would	you	still	be	able	to	love	them?	You	would.	If	a	loved	one	passed	away,
would	you	still	be	able	to	love	them?	You	would.	Even	if	a	loved	one	is	not	physically	with
you	anymore,	you	are	still	capable	of	being	loving.	So,	what	 _is_ 	love	then?	It	is	just	your	own
quality.	You	are	only	using	the	other	person	as	a	key	to	open	up	what	is	already	within	you.

Why	are	you	fumbling	with	keys	when	there	is	no	lock,	when	there	is	no	door,	when	there
is	no	wall?	You	create	illusory	walls	and	doors	and	then	create	illusory	keys—and	then	you
fumble	with	the	keys!	And	once	you	find	the	key,	you	are	terrified	of	losing	it!

For	 most	 people,	 love	 is	 initially	 a	 joy,	 but	 after	 a	 while	 it	 becomes	 an	 anxiety.	 Why?
Because	this	“key”	has	legs	and	a	will	of	its	own.	You	can’t	keep	it	in	your	pocket	or	hang	it
around	your	neck.	When	you	try	to	do	that,	two	lives	are	heading	straight	for	disaster!

Once	your	joy	is	on	self-start	rather	than	push-start,	you	have	upgraded	your	technology.
You	are	no	longer	enslaved	to	an	external	source—whether	a	person	or	a	situation.	You	are
now	capable	of	being	loving	and	blissful	without	doing	anything	in	particular,	just	sitting
here,	no	matter	how	anyone	in	the	outside	world	behaves.	Once	you	experience	this	inner
freedom,	you	will	never	experience	insecurity	in	your	life	again.	And	anyway,	when	you	are	a
truly	blissful	human	being,	everyone	will	naturally	want	to	be	around	you!	Blissfulness	means
life	is	happening	in	an	exuberant	manner,	and	that	is	that	all	life	seeks.

```
So,	how	does	one	upgrade	one’s	inner	technology?
We	will	look	at	this	at	length	in	the	following	chapters.	But	a	fundamental	step	would	be	to
```

recognize	consciously	just	this:	 _“My	 ability	 to	 respond	 is	 limitless,	 but	 my	 ability	 to	 act	 is
limited.	I	am	one	hundred	percent	responsible	for	everything	I	am	and	everything	I	am	not,	for
my	capacities	and	my	incapacities,	for	my	joys	and	my	miseries.	I	am	the	one	who	determines
the	nature	of	my	experience	in	this	life	and	beyond.	I	am	the	maker	of	my	life.”_

Absolutely	nothing	is	required—no	reaction,	no	action,	no	capability—other	than	being
aware	of	the	basic	fact	that	 _your	responsibility	is	limitless_ .	You	could	sit	in	one	place	and	be
aware	of	it.	You	could	walk	the	street	and	be	aware	of	it.	You	could	be	working,	cooking,	or
even	lying	in	bed,	and	be	aware	of	it.

Let	 me	 ask	 you	 another	 question:	 whatever	 your	 religion	 or	 cultural	 background,	 what
exactly	do	you	mean	when	you	use	the	word	“God”?

The	forms,	the	names,	the	ideas	are	varied.	But	essentially,	when	you	say	“God,”	you	mean
that	which	is	responsible	for	everything	in	the	universe.	Suppose	God	said,	“I	will	not	be
responsible	for	you.”	He	is	most	definitely	fired!	The	very	word	“God”	signifies	limitless
responsibility.

So,	responsibility	is	not	a	teaching	in	civics.	It	is	 _the	 simplest	 and	 easiest	 way	 for	 you	 to
express	your	own	divinity_.

The	whole	effort	of	the	spiritual	process	is	to	break	the	boundaries	you	have	drawn	for
yourself	and	experience	the	immensity	that	you	are.	The	aim	is	to	unshackle	yourself	from	the
limited	identity	you	have	forged,	as	a	result	of	your	own	ignorance,	and	live	the	way	the
Creator	made	you—utterly	blissful	and	infinitely	responsible.

After	my	experience	on	Chamundi	Hill,	one	thing	became	clear	to	me.	In	life,	there	is	no
“this”	and	“that”;	there	is	only	“this”	and	“this.”	This	means	everything	is	 _here	and	now._ 	The
access	for	everything	is	here	and	now.	And	it	lies	only	in	one’s	ability	to	respond—in	one’s
ability	to	experience	and	express	the	divine.

There	is	no	“yes”	and	“no.”	There	is	just	“yes”	and	“yes”!	The	choice	is	yours.	You	can
either	react	to	life	with	“yes”	and	“no,”	which	will	mean	a	perpetual	division	of	this	existence,
which	is	the	basis	of	repetitive	cycles	of	conflict	and	misery.	Or	you	can	become	one	big	YES
to	life.

Limited	responsibility	is	a	way	of	drawing	boundaries.	What	you	think	you	are	responsible
for	will	be	within	your	boundary.	What	you	think	you	are	not	responsible	for	will	be	outside
your	boundary.	But	limitless	responsibility	extends	itself	way	beyond	your	present	level	of
understanding	and	perception.	There	is	more—much	more—to	life	than	you	are	aware	of
right	now.	Once	you	choose	to	become	conscious	of	this	simple	fact— _my	ability	to	respond	is
limitless_ —suddenly	 life	 within	 you	 reorganizes	 itself	 in	 a	 completely	 different	 way.	 You
move	into	higher	and	higher	levels	of	freedom	within	yourself.	Life	is	now	a	wonderful	and
exhilarating	journey	of	self-discovery.

```
The	outside	 world	has	 seen	 its	share	 of	bloody	 revolutions.	 They	were	 violent	 because
```

there	 were	 some	 people	 who	 were	 willing	 to	 change	 and	 there	 were	 some	 who	 were
unwilling.	But	in	the	inner	life,	there	is	only	one	kind	of	revolution	and	it	is	a	silent	one.	It	is
about	moving	from	unwillingness	to	willingness.

The	question	is:	do	you	want	to	be	a	full-time	human	being	or	a	part-time	human	being?	If
you	 restrict	 your	 ability	 to	 respond,	 the	 scope	 and	 dimension	 of	 your	 experience	 will	 be
unsurprising,	predictable,	limited,	narrow.	But	to	be	an	absolutely	full-time	human	being	is	to
be	a	constant	full-blooded	response	to	everything.	You	don’t	have	to	do	anything	in	particular.
You	just	need	to	become	a	willing	piece	of	life	in	this	glorious	living	cosmos.

Responsibility	 is	 not	 burdensome.	 Boundaries	 are	 burdensome.	 If	 you	 draw	 yourself	 a
boundary,	whether	of	ideology,	caste,	creed,	race,	or	religion,	you	cannot	move	beyond	it	and
you	end	up	stuck	for	no	reason	at	all.	These	boundaries	only	end	up	breeding	fear,	hatred,	and
anger.	The	bigger	your	boundary,	the	more	burdensome	it	becomes.	But	if	your	responsibility
is	limitless,	where’s	the	boundary?

No	boundary,	no	burden.
This	is	the	turnaround	in	human	consciousness	that	needs	to	take	place.
Once	this	happens,	it	is	not	that	the	cosmos	begins	to	happen	your	way.	Instead,	what	 _you_
are	becomes	cosmic.

```
This	is	not	transcendence;	this	is	homecoming.
```
Sadhana

```
Don’t	simply	believe	what	you	are	reading.	The	only	way	to	find	out	whether	something	is	true	or	untrue	is
to	experiment	with	it.	Stop	the	internal	debate	and	simply	put	it	to	the	test.	The	yogic	path	is	not	a	path	of
inherited	belief;	it	is	the	path	of	experiment.
Here’s	a	practical	way	to	begin.
When	you	have	your	next	meal,	do	not	talk	to	anyone	around	you	for	the	first	fifteen	minutes.	Just	be	in
active	conscious	response	to	the	food	that	you	eat,	the	air	that	you	breathe,	the	water	that	you	drink.
As	I	have	said	earlier,	your	entire	system	is	responding	anyway.	Just	become	conscious	of	it.	This	apple,
this	carrot,	this	piece	of	bread—don’t	take	them	lightly.	If	you	do	not	eat	for	a	couple	of	days,	you	won’t
think	about	God.	You	will	only	think	about	food.	This	is	what	is	nourishing	you	and	making	your	life	right
now.	This	is	the	very	substance	of	your	body.	Respond	to	food	absolutely,	with	total	attention.
This	fruit,	this	egg,	this	bread,	this	vegetable—they	are	all	a	part	of	life	themselves,	but	they	are	willing
to	become	you.	Would	you	be	willing	to	do	this	for	anyone?	You	are	not	willing	to	lose	your	identity	and
merge	into	anyone.	You	are	not	even	willing	to	surrender	your	little	finger	for	someone	else.	Momentarily,
you	surrender	just	a	little,	usually	when	you	need	something.	Your	love	affairs	are	the	product	of	very
calculated	surrender.	But	food,	which	is	a	life	unto	itself,	gives	itself	up	completely	to	become	a	part	of
you.
Later,	without	even	uttering	the	sentence	aloud,	take	the	simple	idea—“My	responsibility	is	limitless;	if	I
am	willing,	I	can	respond	to	everything”—into	the	entire	day.	Be	conscious	of	it	until	the	last	moment
before	you	fall	asleep	and	remind	yourself	of	it	the	first	thing	when	you	wake	up.
If	 you	 sustain	 this	 awareness	 of	 your	 limitless	 nature	 for	 just	 one	 full	 minute,	 you	 will	 achieve	 a
tremendous	transformation.	A	minute	may	seem	very	simple,	but	you	will	see	it	will	take	a	certain	level	of
application	to	arrive	at	this.	Just	one	minute	can	elevate	you	to	a	different	dimension	of	experience	and
```

function.	Right	now,	your	awareness	is	erratic:	this	moment	you	are	aware	and	the	next	moment,	you	are
gone.	It	is	okay.	Every	hour,	remind	yourself.	Experiment	with	this	awareness,	allow	it	to	deepen	and	see
what	happens.
Conscious	response	brings	you	to	a	profound	and	enduring	state	of	connectedness	with	life—not	as	an
idea	or	an	emotion,	but	life	as	life	is.	In	this	willing,	active	involvement	with	life,	you	are	embraced	by	it
and	that	embrace	takes	you	to	the	very	source	of	creation.
That	is	all	it	takes	to	touch	the	Creator—just	willingness,	nothing	else.


Patanjali’s	 _Yoga	 Sutras,_ 	one	of	the	most	profound	documents	on	the	yogic	sciences,	begins
with	a	strange	line:	“...And	now,	yoga.”

A	great	document	on	life	starts	with	just	half	a	sentence!	Why?
This	is	because	you	arrive	at	yoga	only	when	you	realize	that	your	desire	is	essentially	for
the	limitless,	and	that	absolutely	nothing	else	will	settle	you.	Every	human	being	lives	in	a
perpetual	state	of	insufficiency.	No	matter	who	you	are	or	what	you	have	achieved,	you	still
want	a	little	more	than	what	you	have	right	now.	This	is	human	desire.	But	the	fundamental
desire	within	every	human	being	is	for	boundless	expansion.

Most	 people	 are	 not	 aware	 of	 the	 nature	 of	 their	 longing.	 When	 their	 longing	 finds
_unconscious_ expression,	 we	 call	 this	 greed,	 conquest,	 ambition.	 When	 their	 longing	 finds
_conscious_ 	expression,	we	call	this	yoga.

If	you	still	believe	that	everything	will	be	okay	the	moment	you	find	a	new	girlfriend	or
boyfriend,	get	a	raise,	buy	a	new	house	or	car,	then	it	is	not	yet	time	for	yoga.	Once	you’ve
tried	all	those	things	and	more,	and	clearly	know	that	none	of	it	will	ever	be	enough— _then_
you	are	ready.

```
So	now,	yoga.
```
What	exactly	 _is_ 	yoga?

If	you	were	to	close	your	eyes	and	conjure	an	image,	it	would	probably	be	one	of	bodies
twisted	 into	 impossible	 postures.	 Bone-bending,	 muscle-knotting,	 teeth-gnashing
contortionism—that,	for	many,	is	yoga!

The	 trend	 is	 changing	 nowadays	 to	 some	 extent,	 and	 many	 yoga	 studios	 also	 impart
breathing	techniques	and	meditation	processes.	So,	for	some	people,	the	image	of	yoga	might
be	one	of	serenely	smiling	faces	and	perfect	bodies	seated	effortlessly	in	lotus	position.

But	none	of	that	is	what	we	mean	when	we	talk	of	 _the	science	of	yoga_.
Yoga	is	not	a	practice.	It	is	not	an	exercise.	It	is	not	a	technique.	The	images	in	popular
consciousness	point	to	a	bowdlerized	form	of	yoga	that	has	now	pervaded	the	world.	This	is	a


travesty	of	a	science	of	extraordinary	grandeur	and	profundity	that	originated	on	the	Indian
subcontinent.

_The	science	 of	 yoga	is,	 quite	 simply,	the	 science	of	 being	 in	perfect	 alignment,	 in	 absolute
harmony,	in	complete	sync	with	existence._

The	many	fluctuations	of	the	outside	world	have	their	impact	on	each	one	of	us.	But	yoga	is
the	science	of	creating	inner	situations	exactly	the	way	you	want	them.	When	you	fine-tune
yourself	to	such	a	point	where	everything	functions	beautifully	within	you,	naturally	the	best
of	your	abilities	will	flow	out	of	you.

You	have	surely	noticed	that	when	you	are	happy,	you	always	function	better.	You	seem	to
have	an	endless	supply	of	energy.	You	can	go	on	and	on,	even	without	eating	or	sleeping.	Just
a	little	happiness	liberates	you	from	your	normal	limitations	of	energy	and	capability.

When	your	body	and	mind	are	in	a	relaxed	state,	you	are	also	free	of	several	nagging
ailments.	Let’s	say	you	go	and	sit	in	your	office	with	a	headache.	A	headache	is	not	a	major
disease.	But	just	that	throbbing	can	take	away	a	whole	lot	of	your	capability	at	work	and	your
enthusiasm	for	the	job—and	perhaps	for	life	itself.	A	simple	headache	can	turn	what	is	most
precious	to	you	into	a	source	of	vexation	or	even	misery.	(This	also	works	conversely.	When
your	loved	ones	are	irritated	with	you,	they	invariably	feign	a	headache!)	But	with	the	practice
of	yoga,	your	body	and	mind	can	be	maintained	at	the	highest	possible	level	of	capability	and
efficiency.

And	yet,	yoga	is	not	just	a	self-help	tool	for	greater	mental	and	physical	efficiency—and
freedom	from	headaches.	It	is	all	that	and	much	more.

Modern	science	tells	us	that	all	of	existence	is	just	energy	manifesting	itself	in	different
ways	and	in	different	forms.	This	means	that	the	same	energy	that	can	sit	here	as	a	rock	can	lie
there	as	mud,	can	stand	up	as	a	tree,	can	run	like	a	dog—or	be	here	reading	this	book,	as	you.
So,	you	are	essentially	a	morsel	of	energy	that	is	part	of	the	much	larger	energy	system	of	the
universe.	The	cosmos	is	just	one	big	organism.	Your	life	is	not	independent	of	it.	You	cannot
live	without	the	world	because	there	is	a	very	deep	moment-to-moment	transaction	between
the	two	of	you.

Although	everything	in	the	universe	is	the	same	energy,	it	functions	at	different	levels	of
capability	 in	 different	 forms.	 The	 same	 energy	 functions	 in	 one	 plant	 to	 create	 roses;	 in
another	plant	it	functions	to	create	jasmine.	With	the	same	material	with	which	people	made
earthen	pots	we	now	make	computers,	cars,	and	even	spacecrafts!	It	is	the	same	material;	we
have	just	started	using	it	for	higher	and	higher	possibilities.	Essentially,	natural	evolution	is	a
similar	phenomenon:	from	the	same	material	of	this	planet,	what	an	incredible	journey	has
been	made,	from	an	amoeba	to	a	human	being!

It	is	the	same	with	our	inner	energies.	Yoga	is	the	technology	of	upgrading,	activating,	and
refining	these	inner	energies	for	the	highest	possibilities.	Suddenly,	your	capabilities	reach	a
level	of	brilliance	that	you	never	imagined	possible.	An	accidental	and	limited	life	turns	near-
miraculous.

But	yoga	performs	an	even	deeper	function	than	ensuring	well-being	at	body,	mind,	and
energy	levels.	Literally,	yoga	means	“union.”	When	you	are	in	yoga,	it	means	that	in	your


experience,	everything	has	become	one.	This	is	the	essence	of	the	science.	This	is	also	its
deepest	aim.

What	is	this	union?	What	unites	with	what?
Right	now,	you	are	aware	of	someone	called	“me”	and	someone	called	the	“other.”	This
“me”	 and	 “other”	 can	 be	 extended	 to	 groups	 of	 people,	 communities,	 and	 nations,	 but
fundamentally	“me”	and	“other”	is	the	basis	of	conflict	in	the	universe.	The	whole	point	of
yoga	is	to	bring	you	to	an	experience	wherein,	if	you	sit	here,	there	is	no	such	thing	as	“you”
and	“me.”	It	is	all	me—or	all	you!	Any	process	that	helps	you	to	reach	this	union	is	yoga.

How	can	this	union	be	achieved?
There	are	several	ways.	But	let	us	start	at	the	beginning—with	our	ideas	of	what	constitutes
an	individual.	If	I	were	to	start	telling	you	things	you	did	not	know,	you	would	have	a	choice:
to	believe	or	disbelieve	me.	Either	way,	you	have	only	concretized	your	assumptions,	whether
positive	 or	 negative.	 This	 will	 only	 take	 you	 into	 flights	 of	 fanciful	 imagination.	 But	 the
whole	process	of	yoga	is	to	take	you,	step	by	step,	and	stage	by	stage,	 _from	the	known	into	the
unknown_ .	It	is	a	hundred	percent	empirical	science.	It	does	not	ask	you	to	take	anything	on
trust.	It	urges	you	to	experiment	every	step	of	the	way.

So,	first	let	us	look	at	what	exactly	you	understand	by	the	word	“myself.”	Right	now,	in
your	understanding,	this	“you”	is	constituted	by	your	body,	your	mind	(which	includes	your
thoughts	and	emotions),	and	your	energies.	Your	energies	may	not	be	in	your	experience
currently,	but	you	know	them	by	inference:	if	your	body	and	mind	function	as	they	do,	there
must	be	some	kind	of	energy	empowering	them.	These	three	realities—body,	mind,	energy—
are	what	you	know.	They	are	also	what	you	can	work	with.

Yoga	tells	us	that	we	are	actually	composed	of	five	“sheaths,”	or	layers	or,	more	simply,
bodies.	As	there	is	a	medical	physiology,	there	is	a	yogic	one	as	well.	It	leads	us	from	the
gross	to	the	subtlest	levels	of	reality.	Do	you	have	to	believe	in	it?	No.	But	it	is	a	useful	place
at	which	to	start	our	exploration.	Your	fundamental	area	of	work,	however,	is	only	with	the
realities	that	you	are	aware	of.

The	 first	 sheath	 or	 layer	 to	 which	 yoga	 draws	 our	 attention	 is	 the	 physical	 body—the
_annamayakosha,_ 	or	more	literally,	the	food	body.	What	you	call	the	“body”	right	now	is	just
an	accumulated	heap	of	food.	It	is	the	product	of	all	the	nourishment	you	have	ingested	over
the	years.	That	is	how	it	gets	its	name.

The	second	layer	is	the	 _manomayakosha,_ 	or	the	mental	body.	Today,	doctors	are	talking	a
great	deal	about	psychosomatic	ailments.	This	means	that	what	happens	in	the	mind	affects
what	happens	in	the	body.	This	is	because	what	you	call	“mind”	is	not	just	the	brain.	It	is	not
located	in	any	single	part	of	the	human	anatomy.	Instead,	every	cell	has	its	own	intelligence,
so	there	is	an	entire	mental	body,	an	entire	anatomy	of	the	mind.

Whatever	happens	in	the	mental	body	happens	in	the	physical	body,	and,	in	turn,	whatever
happens	in	the	physical	body	happens	in	the	mental	body.	Every	fluctuation	on	the	level	of	the
mind	has	a	chemical	reaction,	and	every	chemical	reaction,	in	turn,	generates	a	fluctuation	on
the	level	of	the	mind.

```
The	 physical	 and	 mental	 bodies	 are	 like	 your	 hardware	 and	 software.	 Hardware	 and
```

software	cannot	do	anything	unless	you	plug	into	quality	power.	So,	the	third	layer	of	the	self
is	the	 _pranamayakosha,_ 	or	the	energy	body.	If	you	keep	your	energy	body	in	perfect	balance,
there	will	be	no	disease	in	your	physical	or	mental	bodies.	Today	there	is	scientific	evidence
to	show	that	the	impact	of	genetic	memory	on	the	human	being	is	not	absolute.	Except	the
fundamental	aspects	of	the	DNA,	everything	can	be	changed,	including	the	genetic	trends	of
susceptibility	 to	 ailments.	 Infectious	 diseases	 happen	 because	 of	 external	 organisms,	 but
chronic	diseases	are	manufactured	daily	by	human	beings.	When	your	energy	body	is	in	full
vibrancy	and	proper	balance,	chronic	diseases	cannot	exist	in	the	body.	I	could	introduce	you
to	thousands	of	people	who	have	gotten	rid	of	their	physical	and	psychological	ailments	just
by	doing	certain	simple	yogic	practices.	These	practices	are	not	aimed	at	the	disease.	They	are
just	aimed	at	bringing	a	certain	harmony	and	vitality	to	the	energy	body.

These	are	the	three	dimensions	of	the	self	you	are	aware	of	right	now:	the	physical,	the
mental,	the	energetic.	They	are	essentially	physical	in	nature,	though	each	is	more	subtle	than
the	preceding	one.	It	is	like	a	lightbulb,	electricity,	and	light—all	these	are	physical.	One	you
can	hold	in	your	hand;	the	other	you	can	feel;	and	the	third	takes	a	sensitive	receptor,	like	the
eye,	to	experience.	But	they	are	essentially	physical,	which	is	why	you	can	experience	them
through	your	sense	organs.

However,	there	is	a	fourth	layer	called	the	 _vignanamayakosha,_ 	or	the	etheric	body.	 _Gnana_
means	“knowledge.”	 _Vishesh	gnana_ 	means	“extraordinary	knowledge”—that	which	is	beyond
the	sense	perceptions.	This	is	a	transient	state.	It	is	neither	physical	nor	non-physical.	It	is	like
a	link	between	the	two.	It	is	not	in	your	current	level	of	experience,	because	your	experience
is	limited	to	the	five	sense	organs	which	cannot	perceive	the	non-physical.	Those	who	report
near-death	experiences	are	those	who	could	have	slipped	accidentally	into	this	state.	Such	an
experience	occurs	when,	for	some	reason,	people’s	physical,	mental,	and	energy	bodies	have
become	 feeble.	 If	 you	 learn	 to	 find	 conscious	 access	 to	 this	 dimension,	 there	 will	 be	 a
quantum	leap	in	your	ability	to	know	the	cosmic	phenomenon.

There	is	also	a	fifth	sheath,	the	 _anandamayakosha,_ 	which	is	beyond	the	physical	entirely.
_Ananda_ 	means	“bliss.”	It	has	nothing	to	do	with	the	physical	realms	of	life.	A	dimension	that	is
beyond	the	physical	cannot	be	described	or	even	defined,	so	yoga	talks	about	it	only	in	terms
of	experience.	When	we	are	in	touch	with	that	aspect	beyond	the	physical,	we	become	blissful.
It	is	not	that	a	bubble	of	bliss	lies	within	your	physical	structure.	It	is	just	that	when	you	access
this	indefinable	dimension,	it	produces	an	overwhelming	experience	of	bliss.

But	bliss	is	not	a	goal	in	itself.	Once	you	touch	this	dimension	of	nonexistence,	blissfulness
is	guaranteed.	In	this	state,	you	are	no	more	an	issue	in	your	own	life.	When	you	are	no	more
an	issue,	you	can	fearlessly	explore	the	beyond.

When	 you	 touch	 this	 dimension	 beyond	 definition,	 the	 impact	 of	 time	 and	 space	 is
obliterated.	This	accounts	for	the	many	stories	of	yogis	sitting	unmoving	for	incredibly	long
periods	 of	 time.	 This	 is	 possible	 not	 because	 of	 physical	 endurance,	 but	 because	 in	 these
states,	they	are	not	available	to	the	process	of	time.	They	have	touched	a	dimension	beyond	all
the	contradictions	of	here	and	there,	now	and	then;	a	limitless	ocean	of	emptiness	where	there
is	neither	bondage	nor	freedom—an	existence	beyond	existence.


Yoga	does	not	ask	you	to	work	with	anything	other	than	what	you	know.	It	simply	tells	you
that	if	the	physical,	mental,	and	energy	bodies	are	perfectly	aligned,	you	will	find	access	to	the
bliss	body.	But	your	work,	as	we	said	before,	is	only	with	the	first	three	bodies.

When	it	 comes	to	 external	 realities,	each	 human	being	 is	 differently	capable.	 What	 one
does,	the	other	may	not	be	able	to	do.	But	when	it	comes	to	inner	realities,	all	of	us	are
equally	capable.	There	is	no	guarantee	that	you	will	be	able	to	sing,	dance,	climb	a	mountain,
or	make	money,	merely	because	you	want	to.	But	making	your	inner	life	blissful	is	something
that	everyone	is	capable	of.	It	 _cannot_ 	be	denied	to	you,	if	you	are	willing.	Once	you	master
certain	 basic	 yogic	 technologies	 of	 inner	 well-being,	 your	 journey	 through	 life	 becomes
absolutely	effortless.	You	are	able	to	express	yourself	at	your	fullest	potential	without	any
stress	or	strain.	You	can	play	with	life	whichever	way	you	want,	but	life	cannot	leave	a	single
scratch	upon	you.

So,	to	experience	well-being	all	you	need	is	a	certain	mastery	over	these	three	dimensions	of
body,	mind,	and	energy.	Being	successful	in	the	world	depends	on	your	ability	to	harness
these	dimensions,	according	to	the	needs	of	your	life	situations	and	the	activity	you	want	to
perform.	But	yoga	is	also	the	science	of	aligning	these	three	dimensions	so	that	you	reach	the
ultimate	state	of	ecstatic	union	with	life	itself.

How	does	one	reach	this	ultimate	union?
Yoga	tells	us	there	are	a	few	fundamental	ways.	If	you	employ	your	physical	body	to	reach
this	 ultimate	 union,	 we	 call	 this	 _karma	 yoga_ ,	 or	 the	 yoga	 of	 action.	 If	 you	 employ	 your
intelligence	to	reach	your	ultimate	nature,	we	call	this	 _gnana	yoga_ ,	the	yoga	of	intelligence.	If
you	employ	your	emotions	to	reach	your	ultimate	nature,	we	call	this	 _bhakti	yoga_ ,	the	yoga	of
devotion.	And	if	you	use	your	energies	to	reach	the	supreme	experience,	we	call	this	 _kriya
yoga_ ,	the	yoga	of	transforming	energies.

Every	human	being	is	a	unique	combination	of	the	same	ingredients.	All	these	aspects—
karma,	 gnana,	 bhakti,	 kriya—have	 to	 function	 in	 an	 integrated	 way,	 if	 one	 wants	 to	 get
anywhere.	If	these	four	dimensions—body,	mind,	emotion,	energy—don’t	walk	together,	you
will	be	one	big	mess.

Once	it	happened...Four	men	were	walking	in	the	forest.	The	first	was	a	gnana	yogi,	the
second	was	a	bhakti	yogi,	the	third	was	a	karma	yogi,	and	the	fourth	was	a	kriya	yogi.

Usually,	these	four	people	can	never	be	together.	The	gnana	yogi	has	total	disdain	for	every
other	type	of	yoga.	His	is	the	yoga	of	the	intellect,	and	typically,	an	intellectual	has	complete
disdain	for	everybody	else,	particularly	these	devotional	types	who	look	upward	and	chant
God’s	name	all	the	time.	They	look	like	a	bunch	of	idiots	to	him.

But	a	bhakti	yogi,	a	devotee,	thinks	all	this	gnana,	karma,	and	kriya	yoga	is	a	waste	of	time.
He	pities	the	others	who	don’t	see	that	all	you	need	to	do	is	know	that	God	exists,	hold	his
hand,	and	walk	in	trust.	All	this	mind-splitting	philosophy,	this	bone-bending	yoga	is	absurd


to	him.

Then	there	is	the	karma	yogi,	the	man	of	action.	He	thinks	all	the	other	types	are	just	plain
lazy.	Their	lives	are	pure	self-indulgence.

But	the	kriya	yogi	is	the	most	disdainful	of	all.	He	laughs	at	everyone.	Don’t	they	know	that
existence	is	just	energy?	If	you	don’t	transform	your	energy,	whether	you	long	for	God	or
for	anything	else,	nothing	is	going	to	happen!	There	can	be	no	transformation.

These	four	people	customarily	cannot	get	along.	But	today	they	happened	to	be	walking
together	in	the	forest.	Suddenly,	a	storm	broke	out.	It	grew	fierce.	The	rain	started	pouring
down	relentlessly.	Drenched	to	the	skin,	the	four	yogis	started	running,	looking	desperately
for	shelter.

The	bhakti	yogi,	the	devotion	man,	said,	“There’s	an	ancient	temple	in	this	direction.	Let’s
go	there.”	(As	a	devotee,	he	was	particularly	familiar	with	the	geography	of	temples.)

They	ran	in	that	direction.	They	came	to	an	ancient	temple;	all	the	walls	had	crumbled	long
ago;	just	the	roof	and	four	columns	remained.	They	rushed	into	the	temple—not	out	of	any
love	for	God,	but	just	to	escape	the	rain.

There	was	a	deity	in	the	center.	They	ran	toward	it.	The	rain	started	lashing	from	every
direction.	There	was	no	other	place	to	go,	so	they	moved	closer	and	closer.	Finally,	there	was
no	alternative.	They	just	sat	down	and	embraced	the	idol.

The	moment	these	four	people	hugged	the	idol,	suddenly	God	appeared.
In	all	their	minds	the	same	question	arose:	why	 _now_ ?	They	wondered,	“We	expounded	so
many	subtle	and	arcane	philosophies,	worshipped	at	every	possible	sacred	shrine,	great	and
small,	selflessly	served	so	many	people,	did	so	much	body-breaking	penance,	but	you	never
showed	up.	Now	when	we’re	just	escaping	the	rain,	you	turn	up.	Why?”

```
God	said,	“At	last	you	four	idiots	got	together.”
```
Yoga	is,	quite	simply,	the	science	of	bringing	the	four	idiots	together.

Right	now,	for	most	people,	these	four	dimensions	are	aligned	in	different	directions.	Your
mind	is	thinking	one	way;	your	emotions	pull	you	another	way;	your	physical	body	another
way;	your	energy	another	way.	This	makes	you	a	potential	calamity,	an	accident	waiting	to
happen.	You	are	being	hijacked—you	are	being	pulled	apart,	in	four	different	ways.

It	is	now	time	to	plunge	into	the	adventure	of	self-alignment,	into	the	remarkable	empirical
system	that	is	yoga—one	that	enables	you	to	be	both	alchemist	and	experiment,	subject	and
object	at	the	same	time.

And	so,	the	next	section	of	this	book	turns	pragmatic.	Having	mapped	the	terrain,	we	now
embark	on	a	real	journey,	a	conscious	journey	of	self-discovery	and	self-reclamation.	We
will	explore	the	nature	and	possibilities	of	the	first	three	yogic	layers,	or	sheaths—namely,
body,	mind	(which	includes	thought	and	emotion),	and	energy.	It	will	also	introduce	you	to


strategies	 by	 which	 you	 can	 turn	 each	 of	 these	 layers	 into	 a	 tool	 for	 transformation,	 an
instrument	of	knowing.

The	 problem	 is	 that	 religious	 nuts	 around	 the	 world	 have	 exported	 everything	 that	 is
beautiful	about	a	human	being	to	the	other	world.	If	you	talk	of	love,	they	speak	of	divine
love.	If	you	talk	of	bliss,	they	speak	of	divine	bliss.	If	you	talk	of	peace,	they	speak	of	divine
peace.	We	have	forgotten	that	these	are	all	 _human_ 	qualities.	A	human	being	is	fully	capable	of
joy,	of	love,	of	peace.	Why	do	you	want	to	export	these	to	heaven?

There	is	so	much	talk	of	God	and	heaven	mainly	because	human	beings	have	not	realized
the	immensity	of	being	human.	It	is	obvious	that	the	very	source	of	life	is	throbbing	within
you	in	some	way.	The	source	of	your	life	is	also	the	source	of	every	other	life	and	the	source
of	all	creation.	This	dimension	of	intelligence	or	consciousness	exists	in	every	one	of	us.	The
deliverance	of	every	human	being	lies	in	finding	access	to	this	deathless	dimension.

To	be	joyful	and	peaceful	within	yourself	every	moment	of	your	life,	to	be	able	to	perceive
life	 beyond	 its	 physical	 limitations—these	 are	 not	 superhuman	 qualities.	 These	 are	 human
possibilities.

```
Yoga	is	not	about	being	superhuman;	it	is	about	realizing	that	being	human	is	super.
```


**A	Note	to	the	Reader**

The	next	part	of	the	book	grows	more	specific,	taking	you	deeper	into	an	exploration	of	the
three	 fundamental	 sheaths,	 or	 layers,	 of	 identity,	 that	 every	 human	 being	 is	 conscious	 of.
Accordingly,	it	is	divided	into	three	sections:	Body,	Mind,	and	Energy.

Within	each	section,	the	book	seeks	to	extend	your	ideas	of	what	constitutes	the	physical,
the	 psychological,	 and	 the	 _pranic_ (or	 energetic).	 In	 the	 process,	 you	 may	 find	 some
assumptions	interrogated,	some	clichés	punctured,	some	commonly	used	terms	redefined,	and
some	unusual	perspectives	explored.

But	you	are	required	to	take	nothing	on	faith.	Yoga,	as	we	have	said	before,	asks	you	to
experiment—and	encourages	you	to	do	so	fearlessly.	And	so,	this	section	oscillates	between
information	and	suggested	practice	and	self-observation	exercises.	It	concretizes	concepts	and
suggests	ways	to	implement	ideas.	In	the	process,	you	can	find	out	for	yourself	whether	these
concepts	are	workable,	or	if	they	are	simply	so	much	hot	air.

What	is	the	best	way	to	approach	this	section?	You	may	not	feel	inclined	to	implement	each
of	 the	 exercises	 offered	 in	 the	 “Sadhana”	 boxes.	 That	 is	 absolutely	 fine.	 The	 reason	 for
offering	you	a	range	of	practices	and	tips	is	so	that	you	can	zero	in	on	any	that	appeal	to	you.
These	steps	are	simply	intended	to	help	you	make	the	transition	from	the	page	to	the	business
of	daily	living,	to	offer	you	the	freedom	to	test	every	hypothesis	in	the	laboratory	of	your
own	life.	This	section	aims	at	turning	you	from	a	passive	reader,	an	armchair	yogi,	into	a
dynamic	participant	in	the	magic	of	a	life	consciously	lived,	freely	chosen.

It’s	time	to	roll	up	your	preconceived	notions	and	gear	up	for	an	uninhibited	exploration	of
the	incredible	life	that	you	are.



**The	Ultimate	Machine**

The	most	intimate	part	of	physical	creation	for	all	of	us	is	our	own	bodies.	The	physical	body
is	the	first	gift	of	which	we	are	aware.	It	is	also	the	ultimate	machine.	Every	other	machine	on
the	planet	has	come	out	of	this.

The	yogic	sciences,	as	explained	above,	do	not	speak	of	the	mind	or	the	soul.	Everything	is
just	a	body—whether	it	is	a	food	body,	a	mind	body,	an	energy	body,	an	etheric	body,	or	a
bliss	 body.	 There	 is	 a	 deep	 wisdom	 in	 this	 approach.	 It	 does	 not	 allow	 us	 to	 escape	 into
deluded	psychological	states	or	into	flights	of	metaphysical	abstraction.	It	grounds	us	firmly
in	the	tangible,	even	as	it	leads	us	into	subtler	realms	of	physicality	and,	gradually,	into	the
beyond.

The	physical	body	is	designed	and	structured	to	function	by	itself	without	much	of	your
intervention.	 You	 don’t	 have	 to	 make	 the	 heart	 beat,	 the	 liver	 perform	 all	 its	 complex
chemistry,	or	even	try	to	breathe;	everything	that	is	needed	for	your	physical	existence	to
manifest	itself	is	happening	on	its	own.

The	 body	 is	 a	 pretty	 complete	 and	 self-contained	 instrument.	 If	 you	 are	 fascinated	 by
machines,	there	isn’t	a	better	one!	This	is	the	most	sophisticated	piece	of	machinery	on	this
planet—it	embodies	the	highest	level	of	mechanics,	the	highest	level	of	electronics,	the	most
sophisticated	electrical	circuitry	you	can	imagine.

Let	 us	 say	 you	 eat	 a	 banana	 this	 afternoon.	 By	 evening,	 this	 banana	 has	 become	 _you_.
According	 to	 Charles	 Darwin,	 it	 took	 millions	 of	 years	 to	 make	 a	 monkey	 into	 a	 human
being,	but	in	just	a	few	hours	you	are	capable	of	making	a	banana	or	a	piece	of	bread	into	a
human	being!	Obviously,	 _the	very	source	of	creation	is	functioning	within	you_.

There	is	an	intelligence	at	work	within	you,	way	beyond	your	logical	mind,	which	can
transform	 a	 bit	 of	 food	 into	 the	 highest	 piece	 of	 technological	 excellence.	 If	 you	 could
achieve	that	transformation	consciously	(instead	of	unconsciously),	if	you	could	bring	even	a
drop	of	that	intelligence	into	your	daily	life,	you	would	live	magically,	not	miserably.

It	is	because	he	experienced	the	source	of	creation	throbbing	within	him	that	the	twelfth-
century	Indian	mystic	Basavanna	famously	called	the	body	a	“moving”	temple.	“My	legs	are
pillars,”	he	says	in	one	of	the	well-known	verses	of	South	Indian	mystical	literature,	“the	body
the	shrine	/	the	head	a	cupola	of	gold...”


**“Something	there	is	that**

**doesn’t	love	a	wall”**

It	takes	a	certain	amount	of	awareness	for	a	person	to	see	the	limitations	of	this	fantastic
machinery.	As	a	machine,	the	body	is	actually	faultless.	The	only	problem	is	that	it	does	not
take	you	anywhere.	It	just	springs	out	of	the	earth	and	falls	back	into	the	earth.

Isn’t	that	enough?
If	 you	 look	 at	 it	 from	 the	 perspective	 of	 the	 body,	 it	 _is_ quite	 enough.	 But	 somehow,	 a
dimension	 beyond	 physicality	 has	 infused	 itself	 into	 this	 wonderful	 mechanism.	 This
dimension	is	the	very	source	of	life.	It	is	this	dimension	that	truly	makes	us	who	we	are.

Life	is	one	thing,	but	the	source	of	life	is	another.	In	every	creature,	in	every	plant,	in	every
seed,	 this	 source	 of	 life	 is	 at	 work.	 In	 a	 human	 being,	 this	 source	 of	 life	 is	 even	 more
magnificently	obvious.

It	is	because	of	this	that	suddenly	after	a	while,	all	the	wonderful	gifts	that	the	body	offers
somehow	seem	to	turn	irrelevant	and	trivial.	It	is	because	of	this	that	you	and	every	other
human	 being	 seem	 to	 live	 in	 a	 constant	 struggle	 between	 the	 physical	 and	 the	 dimension
beyond	the	physical.	Though	you	have	the	compulsiveness	of	the	physical,	you	also	have	the
consciousness	of	being	more	than	just	physical.

There	are	two	basic	forces	within	you.	Most	people	see	them	as	being	in	conflict.	One	is	the
instinct	of	self-preservation,	which	compels	you	to	build	walls	around	yourself	to	protect
yourself.	The	other	is	the	constant	desire	to	expand,	to	become	boundless.	These	two	longings
—to	preserve	and	to	expand—are	 _not_ 	opposing	forces,	though	they	may	seem	to	be.	They	are
related	to	two	different	aspects	of	your	life.	One	force	helps	you	root	yourself	well	on	this
planet;	the	other	takes	you	beyond.	Self-preservation	needs	to	be	limited	to	the	physical	body.
If	you	have	the	necessary	awareness	to	separate	the	two,	there	is	no	conflict.	But	if	you	are
identified	with	the	physical,	then	instead	of	working	in	collaboration,	these	two	fundamental
forces	become	a	source	of	tension.

All	of	the	“material-versus-spiritual”	struggles	of	humanity	spring	from	this	ignorance.
When	 you	 say	 “spirituality,”	 you	 are	 talking	 about	 a	 dimension	 beyond	 the	 physical.	 The
human	 desire	 to	 transcend	 the	 limitations	 of	 the	 physical	 is	 a	 completely	 natural	 one.	 To
journey	from	the	boundary-based	individual	body	to	the	boundless	source	of	creation—this	is
the	very	basis	of	the	spiritual	process.

The	walls	of	self-preservation	that	you	build	for	today	are	the	walls	of	self-imprisonment
for	tomorrow.	Boundaries	that	you	establish	in	your	life	as	a	protection	for	yourself	today
will	 feel	 like	 constraints	 tomorrow.	 Robert	 Frost	 captured	 a	 deep	 truth	 when	 he	 wrote,
“Something	there	is	that	doesn’t	love	a	wall.”


Because	your	self-preservation	instinct	keeps	telling	you,	“Unless	you	have	walls	you	are
not	safe,”	unconsciously	you	keep	building	them.	Later,	you	struggle	with	them.	This	is	an
endless	cycle.	But	creation	is	not	unwilling	to	open	to	you	the	doors	to	the	beyond.	It	is	not
creation’s	unwillingness	that	you	are	struggling	with.	You	are	struggling	with	the	walls	of
resistance	that	 _you_ 	have	built	around	yourself.

That	is	why	the	yogic	system	does	not	talk	about	God.	It	does	not	talk	about	the	soul	or
heaven.	Such	talk	invariably	makes	people	hallucinatory.	Yoga	talks	only	about	the	barriers
that	you	have	set	up,	because	this	resistance	is	all	that	needs	to	be	attended	to.	The	Creator	is
not	looking	for	your	attention.	The	ropes	that	bind	you	and	the	walls	that	block	you—these
are	one	hundred	percent	of	your	making.	And	these	are	all	you	need	to	unknot	and	dismantle.
You	 have	 no	 work	 with	 existence.	 You	 only	 have	 work	 with	 the	 existence	 that	 _you_ have
created.

If	I	were	to	use	an	analogy,	I	would	juxtapose	gravity	and	grace.	Gravity	is	related	in	a	way
to	the	fundamental	instinct	of	self-preservation	in	a	human	being.	We	are	rooted	to	the	planet
right	now	because	of	gravity.	We	have	a	body	today	only	because	of	gravity.	Gravity	is	trying
to	hold	you	down,	whereas	grace	is	a	force	that	is	trying	to	lift	you	up.	If	you	are	released
from	the	physical	forces	of	existence,	then	grace	bursts	forth	in	your	life.

As	gravity	is	active,	grace	too	is	constantly	active.	It	is	just	that	you	have	to	make	yourself
available	to	it.	With	gravity	you	have	no	choice;	you	are	available	to	it,	anyway.	If	you	are
strongly	identified	with	the	physical,	gravity	is	all	that	you	will	know.	But	with	grace,	you
have	to	make	yourself	receptive.	Whatever	kind	of	spiritual	practice	you	do,	ultimately,	you
are	just	working	toward	making	yourself	available	to	grace.

When	you	are	available	to	grace,	suddenly,	you	seem	to	function	like	magic.	Suppose	you
were	the	only	one	who	could	ride	a	bicycle,	you	would	begin	to	seem	magical	to	everyone
else!	It	is	the	same	with	grace.	Others	might	think	you	 _are_ 	magic,	but	you	know	you	are	just
beginning	to	become	receptive	to	a	new	dimension	of	life.	This	possibility	is	available	to
everybody.

You	may	have	noticed	this	about	yourself:	when	you	are	feeling	pleasant,	you	want	to	expand;	when	you
are	fearful,	you	want	to	contract.	Try	this.	Sit	for	a	few	minutes	in	front	of	a	plant	or	tree.	Remind	yourself
that	you	are	inhaling	what	the	tree	is	exhaling,	and	exhaling	what	the	tree	is	inhaling.	Even	if	you	are	not
yet	experientially	aware	of	it,	establish	a	psychological	connection	with	the	plant.	You	could	repeat	this
several	times	a	day.	After	a	few	days,	you	will	start	connecting	with	everything	around	you	differently.
You	won’t	limit	yourself	to	a	tree.
Using	this	simple	process,	we	at	the	Isha	Yoga	Center	have	unleashed	an	environmental	initiative	in	the
South	Indian	state	of	Tamil	Nadu,	under	which	twenty-one	million	trees	have	been	planted	since	2004.	We
spent	several	years	planting	trees	in	people’s	minds,	which	is	the	most	difficult	terrain!	Now	transplanting
those	onto	land	happens	that	much	more	effortlessly.

**Life	Sense:	Knowing	Life**

**Beyond	the	Senses**

How	does	the	human	body	make	sense	of	the	world?	What	is	its	source	of	knowing?

The	answer	is	obvious:	through	the	five	senses.
Whatever	 you	 know	 of	 the	 world	 or	 yourself	 is	 information	 you	 have	 gathered	 only
through	the	five	sense	organs—by	seeing,	hearing,	smelling,	tasting,	and	touching.	If	these
sense	organs	fold	up,	you	would	know	neither	the	world	nor	yourself.

When	 you	 sleep	 every	 night,	 suddenly	 the	 people	 around	 you	 disappear,	 the	 world
disappears,	and	even	 _you_ 	disappear.	You	are	still	alive,	everybody	around	you	is	alive,	but	in
your	 experience	 everything	 evaporates,	 because	 these	 five	 sense	 organs	 have	 gone	 into
“shutdown”	mode.

The	 sense	 organs	 are	 limited.	 They	 can	 perceive	 only	 that	 which	 is	 physical.	 If	 your
perception	is	limited	to	the	five	senses,	naturally	the	scope	of	your	life	will	be	restricted	to	the
physical.	Additionally,	the	senses	perceive	everything	only	 _in	relation	to_ 	something	else.	If	I
touch	a	metal	object	and	it	feels	cool	to	my	fingers,	it	is	simply	because	my	body	temperature
is	warmer.	Suppose	I	lower	my	temperature	and	touch	it,	it	would	feel	warm	to	me.

The	sense	perceptions	are	absolutely	wonderful	instruments	for	human	survival.	They	are
turned	 on	 at	 the	 moment	 of	 your	 birth	 because	 they	 are	 essential	 to	 your	 survival	 in	 the
outside	world.	But	if	you	are	seeking	something	more	than	survival,	they	are	not	enough.
They	give	you	a	distorted	impression	of	reality	because	they	are	entirely	relative	in	their
perception.

If	you	are	really	interested	in	knowing	life	in	all	its	depth	and	dimension,	it	is	imperative
that	you	look	inward,	not	out.	Why?	Because	the	essential	nature	of	life	does	not	lie	in	the
physical	 or	 psychological	 expression	 of	 body	 and	 mind,	 but	 in	 their	 source.	 However,
looking	inward	doesn’t	happen	easily.	It	takes	work,	because	you	don’t	yet	have	the	perceptual
mechanisms	 to	 look	 within.	 The	 human	 predicament	 is	 just	 this:	 _the	 very	 seat	 of	 your
experience	is	within	you,	but	your	perception	is	entirely	outward	bound_.

This	is	why	there	is	such	a	big	disconnect	between	within	and	without.	You	can	see	what	is
outside	you,	but	you	cannot	see	what	is	inside	you.	Even	if	someone	whispers,	you	can	hear	it,
but	there	is	so	much	activity	happening	in	the	body	that	is	beyond	your	ability	to	hear.	If	even
an	ant	crawls	upon	your	skin	you	can	sense	it	right	away,	but	there	is	so	much	blood	flowing
within	you	that	you	cannot	feel.	Your	sense	organs	can	only	register	external	sensations	of
sight,	 sound,	 smell,	 taste,	 and	 touch.	 But	 the	 source	 of	 all	 experience	 is	 _within_ you.	 An
experience	may	be	triggered	by	an	external	stimulus,	but	its	origin	is	always	internal—and
there	are	times	when	the	same	experience	can	be	generated	even	without	an	external	trigger.


Yoga	is	fundamentally	aimed	at	enhancing	your	experience	beyond	the	five	senses.	There	 _is_
a	dimension	beyond	your	five	sense	perceptions.	You	can	call	that	dimension	whatever	you
please.	You	can	call	it	“self,”	if	you	choose.	You	can	call	it	“divine,”	if	you	choose.	You	can
term	it	“God,”	if	you	choose.	The	terminology	is	entirely	up	to	you.

And	even	if	you	are	not	in	quest	of	the	divine	or	the	self,	enhancing	your	perception	can
play	a	vital	role	in	assuring	a	fundamental	level	of	well-being.	Whatever	you	are—doctor,
policeman,	 engineer,	 artist,	 homemaker,	 or	 student—fundamentally,	 it	 is	 your	 quality	 of
perception	that	determines	how	effective	and	successful	you	are	and	how	much	you	can	do	on
this	planet.	The	expansion	of	your	sense	perception	beyond	its	present	boundaries	can	achieve
phenomenal	results,	bringing	a	completely	new	and	seemingly	magical	dimension	to	your
life.

The	common	questions	are:	“Is	it	very	difficult	to	enhance	my	perception?	Do	I	have	to
withdraw	to	a	Himalayan	cave	to	turn	inward?”

Not	at	all.	This	possibility	does	not	come	from	sitting	somewhere	on	top	of	a	mountain;	it
is	 within	 you.	 The	 only	 reason	 it	 has	 been	 inaccessible	 is	 that	 you	 are	 either	 busy	 or
preoccupied	with	what	is	happening	outside	or	far	too	engaged	in	your	own	psychological
drama.	It	is	just	a	lack	of	attention	which	has	denied	people	the	possibility	of	discovering	what
lies	within.

Turning	 inward	 does	 not	 have	 anything	 to	 do	 with	 thoughts,	 ideas,	 opinions,	 or
philosophies.	It	has	nothing	to	do	with	the	psychological	activity	of	your	mind.	Enhancing
your	perception	means	enhancing	your	ability	to	receive	life,	just	as	it	is.	If	you	are	willing	to
dedicate	just	a	few	minutes	of	your	life	to	this	every	day,	you	would	see	the	change.	The
simple	process	of	paying	a	little	bit	of	attention	to	your	inner	nature	will	transform	the	quality
of	your	life	in	remarkable	ways.

Sadhana

```
Start	by	paying	attention	to	everything	you	think	of	as	yourself	just	before	you	fall	asleep:	your	thoughts,
your	emotions,	your	hair,	your	skin,	your	clothes,	your	makeup.	Know	that	none	of	this	is	you.	There	is	no
need	to	make	any	conclusion	about	what	“you”	are	or	what	“truth”	is.	Truth	is	not	a	conclusion.	If	you
keep	the	false	conclusions	at	bay,	truth	will	dawn.	It	is	like	your	experience	of	the	night:	the	sun	has	not
gone;	it	is	just	that	the	planet	is	looking	the	other	way.	You’re	thinking,	reading,	talking	about	the	self,
because	you’re	too	busy	looking	the	other	way!	You	haven’t	paid	enough	attention	to	know	what	the	self
really	is.	What	is	needed	is	not	a	conclusion,	but	a	turnaround.	If	you	manage	to	enter	sleep	with	this
awareness,	 it	 will	 be	 significant.	 Since	 there	 is	 no	 external	 interference	 in	 sleep,	 this	 will	 grow	 into	 a
powerful	experience.	Over	time,	you	will	enter	a	dimension	beyond	all	accumulations.
```

**Listening	to	Life**

There	are	several	ways	to	attain	a	state	of	abiding	joy	and	ultimate	union.	These	are	diverse,
but	it	is	important	that	they	are	all	addressed	in	a	balanced	and	integrated	way.	There	is	really
no	division	or	hierarchy	between	these	varied	approaches.	Yoga	is	completely	evenhanded:	it
employs	 _all	the	aspects_ 	of	who	you	are	to	take	you	to	your	ultimate	destination.

The	body	constitutes	a	very	large	part	of	who	you	are	in	your	present	understanding.	The
science	of	using	the	body	to	hasten	your	evolutionary	process	is	hatha	yoga.	 _Ha_ 	denotes	the
sun	and	 _tha_ 	denotes	the	moon.	Hatha	yoga	is	the	science	of	bringing	about	a	balance	between
these	two	dimensions	within	the	human	system.

The	body	has	its	own	attitudes,	its	own	resistance,	its	own	temperament.	Let	us	say	you
decide,	“Starting	tomorrow,	I	will	get	up	at	five	in	the	morning	and	go	for	a	walk.”	You	set
the	alarm.	The	alarm	rings.	You	begin	to	stir,	but	your	body	groans	and	says,	“Shut	up	and
sleep.”	That	is	often	the	way	it	is,	isn’t	it?	So,	hatha	yoga	is	a	way	of	working	with	the	body,	a
way	of	disciplining,	purifying,	and	preparing	it	for	higher	levels	of	energy	and	for	greater
possibilities.

Hatha	yoga	is	 _not_ 	exercise.	It	is,	instead,	about	understanding	the	mechanics	of	the	body,
creating	 a	 certain	 atmosphere,	 and	 then	 using	 physical	 postures	 to	 channel	 or	 drive	 your
energy	in	specific	directions.	This	is	the	aim	of	the	various	 _asanas,_ 	or	postures.	That	kind	of
posture	that	allows	you	to	access	your	higher	nature	is	a	 _yogasana_ .	It	is	the	science	of	aligning
your	inner	geometry	with	the	cosmic	geometry.

To	put	it	in	the	simplest	way,	just	by	observing	the	way	some	people	sit,	you	can	almost
know	 what	 is	 happening	 with	 them,	 if	 you	 have	 known	 them	 long	 enough.	 If	 you	 have
observed	yourself,	when	you	are	angry,	you	sit	one	way;	if	you	are	happy,	you	sit	another
way;	if	you	are	depressed,	you	sit	another	way.	For	every	different	level	of	consciousness,	or
psychological	state,	your	body	naturally	tends	to	assume	certain	postures.	The	converse	of
this	is	the	science	of	asanas.	 _If	you	consciously	get	your	body	into	different	postures,	you	can
elevate	your	consciousness_.

The	body	can	become	a	means	for	your	spiritual	growth	or	it	can	become	a	barrier.	Let’s
suppose	some	part	of	your	body—your	hand,	leg,	or	back,	for	instance—is	in	pain.	When	the
pain	is	acute,	it	is	hard	to	aspire	to	anything	higher	because	that	pain	becomes	dominant	in
your	life.	Right	now	if	you	have	a	backache,	the	biggest	issue	in	the	universe	is	your	back.
Other	 people	 may	 not	 understand	 that,	 but	 for	 you,	 that	 _is_ the	 biggest	 issue.	 Even	 if	 God
appears	 before	 you,	 you	 will	 plead	 for	 your	 backache	 to	 go	 away!	 You	 will	 not	 ask	 for
anything	else	because	the	physical	body	has	such	power	over	you.	When	it	doesn’t	function	as
it	should,	it	can	rob	your	life	of	every	other	aspiration.	All	your	longings	just	disappear	once
the	body	is	in	pain.	To	experience	pain	and	still	look	beyond	it	takes	an	enormous	amount	of


strength,	which	most	people	do	not	possess.

There	are	countless	people	who	have	come	out	of	spinal	problems	by	doing	simple	asanas.
Doctors	had	told	them	they	would	have	to	undergo	surgery,	but	they	were	able	to	avoid	it
altogether.	Your	back	can	be	restored	to	such	an	excellent	condition	that	you	never	need	to
visit	a	chiropractor	again.	It	is	not	only	your	spine	that	becomes	flexible;	 _you_ 	become	flexible
as	well.	Once	you	are	flexible,	you	are	willing	to	listen.	It	is	not	about	hearing	someone	talk;
you	are	willing	to	 _listen	to	life_ .	Learning	to	listen	is	the	essence	of	intelligent	living.

Dedicating	a	certain	amount	of	effort	and	time	to	see	that	the	body	does	not	become	a
barrier	is	important.	A	painful	body	can	become	an	obstacle,	and	so	can	a	compulsive	body.
Simple	compulsions,	whether	of	hunger	or	lust,	can	rule	you	so	strongly	that	they	will	not
allow	you	to	look	beyond	the	physical.	It	is	easy	to	forget	that	the	physical	body	is	only	 _a	part_
of	you;	it	is	important	that	it	does	not	become	the	whole	of	you.	Asanas	help	level	the	physical
body	down	to	its	natural	place.

As	 you	 move	 into	 deeper	 dimensions	 of	 meditation,	 your	 energies	 will	 surge	 upward,
opening	up	more	profound	dimensions	of	experience.	It	is	very	important,	therefore,	that	the
pipeline	of	the	body	is	conducive.	If	it	is	blocked,	it	will	not	work.	And	so,	preparing	the	body
sufficiently	before	one	goes	into	more	intense	forms	of	meditation	is	very	important.	Hatha
yoga	ensures	that	the	body	takes	the	upsurge	of	energy	smoothly	and	joyfully.

For	 a	 lot	 of	 people,	 spiritual	 growth	 happens	 very	 painfully	 because	 the	 necessary
preparation	has	not	taken	place.	Most	human	beings	have	unfortunately	allowed	themselves	to
be	molded	entirely	by	external	situations.	It	is	becoming	a	norm	in	the	world	that	growth
happens	only	painfully.	It	can	also	happen	blissfully,	but	that	is	when	both	the	body	and	mind
have	been	prepared.	Asanas	can	prepare	you	for	growth	and	transformation	by	equipping	you
with	a	solid	and	stable	foundation.

Today,	the	hatha	yoga	that	people	are	learning	is	not	the	classical	form	in	its	full	depth	and
magnitude.	The	“studio	yoga”	that	you	see	today	is	largely	the	physical	aspect	of	the	science.
Just	 teaching	 the	 physical	 aspect	 of	 yoga	 is	 like	 having	 a	 stillborn	 baby.	 It	 is	 not	 only
inefficient;	it	is	a	tragedy.	If	you	want	a	live	process,	it	needs	to	be	transmitted	in	a	manner
that	is	inclusive	of	other	dimensions	of	yoga.

Hatha	yoga	does	not	mean	standing	on	your	head	or	holding	your	breath.	It	is	the	way	that	it
is	done	that	makes	all	the	difference.	There	was	a	time	when	I	personally	taught	hatha	yoga	as
a	two-day	program.	People	would	be	overwhelmed	with	intensity	at	these	programs;	tears	of
ecstasy	would	flow,	simply	with	the	practice	of	asanas.	Why	doesn’t	this	happen	more	often?
Simply	 because	 hatha	 yoga	 is	 being	 imparted	 as	 an	 end	 unto	 itself,	 rather	 than	 as	 a
preparatory	system.	Consequently,	while	the	hatha	yoga	in	the	world	today	brings	peace	for	a
few	and	health	for	others,	it	is	unfortunately	a	painful	circus	for	many.	This	may	be	fine	for
someone	whose	aspiration	is	only	peace	and	health.	But	you	are	looking	at	yoga	as	a	means
of	transforming	yourself	into	a	receptive	possibility	beyond	the	five	senses,	the	hatha	yoga
needs	to	be	approached	in	its	classical	form.


Sadhana

Look	around.	Among	your	family,	coworkers,	and	friends,	can	you	see	how	everyone	has	different	levels
of	perception?	Just	observe	this	closely.	If	you	know	a	few	people	who	seem	to	have	a	greater	clarity	of
perception	 than	 others,	 watch	 how	 they	 conduct	 their	 body.	 They	 often	 have	 a	 certain	 poise	 without
practice.	But	just	a	little	practice	can	make	an	enormous	difference.	If	you	sit	for	just	a	few	hours	a	day
with	your	spine	erect,	you	will	see	that	it	will	have	an	unmistakable	effect	on	your	life.	You	will	now
begin	to	understand	what	I	mean	by	the	geometry	of	your	existence.	Just	the	way	you	hold	your	body
determines	almost	everything	about	you.
Another	way	of	listening	to	life	is	paying	attention	to	it	experientially,	not	intellectually	or	emotionally.
Choose	any	one	thing	about	yourself:	your	breath,	your	heartbeat,	your	pulse,	your	little	finger.	Just	pay
attention	to	it	for	eleven	minutes	at	a	time.	Do	this	at	least	three	times	a	day.	Keep	your	attention	on	any
sensation,	but	feel	free	to	continue	doing	whatever	you	are	doing.	If	you	lose	attention,	it	doesn’t	matter.
Simply	refocus	your	attention.	This	practice	will	allow	you	to	move	from	mental	alertness	to	awareness.
You	will	find	the	quality	of	your	life	experience	will	begin	to	change.


**Downloading	the	Cosmos**

Until	recently	in	India,	after	every	storm,	you	had	to	go	up	to	your	roof	and	adjust	your	TV
antenna.	Only	if	it	was	angled	in	a	certain	way	did	the	world	pour	into	your	living	room.	Or
else,	 as	 you	 were	 watching	 your	 favorite	 soap	 opera	 or	 football	 match,	 a	 blizzard	 would
suddenly	appear	on	your	screen.

The	body	is	like	that	antenna:	if	you	hold	it	in	the	right	position,	it	becomes	receptive	to	all
there	 is	 in	 existence.	 If	 you	 hold	 it	 another	 way,	 you	 will	 remain	 absolutely	 ignorant	 of
everything	beyond	the	five	senses.

Here	is	another	analogy:	Your	body	is	like	a	barometer.	If	you	know	how	to	read	it,	it	can
tell	you	everything	about	you	and	the	world	around	you.	The	body	never	lies.	So	in	yoga,	we
learn	to	trust	the	body.	 _We	transform	the	physical	body	from	a	series	of	compulsions	of	flesh,
blood,	 and	 hormones	 into	 a	 conscious	 process,	 a	 powerful	 instrument	 of	 perception	 and
knowing_ .	If	you	know	how	to	read	the	body,	it	can	tell	you	your	potential,	your	limitations,
even	your	past,	present,	and	future.	That	is	why	the	fundamental	yoga	starts	with	the	physical
body.

It	is	as	simple	as	this.	The	more	you	know	about	your	telephone	or	any	other	gadget,	the
better	you	can	use	it.	A	few	years	ago,	the	cellphone	companies	conducted	a	survey,	and	found
that	 ninety-seven	 percent	 of	 the	 people	 were	 using	 only	 seven	 percent	 of	 a	 phone’s
capabilities.	I	am	not	talking	about	the	smartphone	here,	but	the	“dumb”	one!	Even	with	that
simple	gizmo,	people	were	using	 _only	seven	percent_.

Now,	as	we	have	already	said,	this	body	of	yours	is	the	ultimate	machine,	the	perfect	state-
of-the-art	gadget.	What	percentage	of	 _this_ 	machine	do	you	think	you	are	employing?

Well	 below	 one	 percent!	 To	 conduct	 your	 life	 in	 the	 material	 world,	 to	 ensure	 your
survival,	you	do	not	need	even	one	percent	of	the	body’s	capabilities.	We	are	doing	all	kinds
of	 trivial	 things	 with	 it	 because	 right	 now	 our	 whole	 perception	 of	 life	 is	 limited	 to	 the
physical	nature	of	existence.	But	your	body	is	capable	of	perceiving	the	whole	universe.	If
you	prepare	it	properly,	it	can	grasp	everything	in	this	existence,	because	all	that	happens	to
this	existence	is	happening,	in	some	way,	to	this	body.

All	physical	creation	is	fundamentally	a	certain	perfection	of	geometry.	Without	geometry,
no	physical	form	is	possible.	If	we	get	the	geometry	of	the	human	body	right,	it	becomes
capable	 of	 reflecting	 the	 larger	 geometry	 of	 the	 cosmos	 within,	 and	 making	 the	 cosmic
available	for	our	experience.	In	other	words,	the	human	body	is	capable	of	downloading	the
entire	cosmos.


Sadhana

Sit	in	any	comfortable	posture,	with	your	spine	erect,	and	if	necessary,	supported.	Remain	still.	Allow	your
attention	to	slowly	grow	still	as	well.	Do	this	for	five	to	seven	minutes	a	day.	You	will	notice	that	your
breath	will	slow	down.
What	is	the	significance	of	slowing	down	the	human	breath?	Is	it	just	some	respiratory	yogic	acrobatics?
No,	it	is	not.	A	human	being	breathes	twelve	to	fifteen	times	per	minute,	normally.	If	your	breath	settles
down	 to	 twelve,	 you	 will	 know	 the	 ways	 of	 the	 earth’s	 atmosphere	 (i.e.,	 you	 will	 become
meteorologically	sensitive).	If	it	reduces	to	nine,	you	will	know	the	language	of	the	other	creatures	on	this
planet.	If	it	reduces	to	six,	you	will	know	the	very	language	of	the	earth.	If	it	reduces	to	three,	you	will
know	the	language	of	the	source	of	creation.	This	is	not	about	increasing	your	aerobic	capacity.	Nor	is	it
about	 forcefully	 depriving	 yourself	 of	 breath.	 A	 combination	 of	 hatha	 yoga	 and	 an	 advanced	 yogic
practice	called	the	 _kriya,_ 	will	gradually	increase	your	lung	capacity,	but	above	all,	will	help	you	achieve
a	certain	alignment,	a	certain	ease,	so	that	your	system	evolves	to	a	state	of	stability	where	there	is	no
static,	no	crackle;	it	just	perceives	everything.


```
INTENSITY	OF	INACTIVITY
```
Logically,	somebody	who	never	put	effort	into	anything	should	be	the	master
of	effortlessness.	But	it	is	not	so.	If	you	want	to	know	effortlessness,	you	need
to	 know	 effort.	 When	 you	 reach	 the	 peak	 of	 effort,	 you	 become	 effortless.
Only	a	person	who	knows	what	it	is	to	work	understands	rest.	Paradoxically,
those	who	are	always	resting	know	no	rest;	they	only	sink	into	dullness	and
lethargy.	This	is	the	way	of	life.

For	the	Russian	ballet	dancer	Nijinsky,	his	entire	life	was	dance.	There	were
moments	 when	 he	 would	 leap	 to	 heights	 that	 seemed	 humanly	 impossible.
Even	if	one’s	muscles	are	at	peak	performance,	there	is	still	a	limit	to	how
high	one	can	jump.	But	in	some	moments	he	would	seem	to	transcend	even
that	limit.

People	often	asked	him,	“How	do	you	manage	this?”
He	said,	“There	is	no	way	I	can	ever	do	it.	When	Nijinsky	is	not	there,	only
then	it	happens.”

When	someone	is	constantly	giving	a	hundred	percent,	a	point	comes	when
one	surpasses	all	limits	and	reaches	total	effortlessness.	Effortlessness	does
not	 mean	 becoming	 a	 couch	 potato.	 It	 means	 transcending	 the	 need	 for
physical	action.	Only	when	you	are	able	to	stretch	to	your	utmost	and	sustain
the	peak	of	effort	do	you	reach	this.	There	are	some	people	nowadays,	who
declare	that	they	would	like	to	opt	for	Zen	as	a	spiritual	path	because	they	think
it	means	doing	nothing!	In	fact,	Zen	involves	tremendous	activity	because	it	is
not	divorced	from	life	in	any	way.	For	example,	a	Zen	monk	may	take	weeks
to	simply	arrange	pebbles	in	a	Zen	garden.	In	performing	such	activity,	you
reach	 a	 state	 of	 non-doing,	 where	 you	 transcend	 the	 experience	 of	 being	 a
doer.	It	is	in	such	states	that	you	have	a	taste	of	the	beyond.

If	you	achieve	such	states	through	intense	activity,	as	Nijinsky	and	many
others	have,	those	moments	will	always	be	cherished	as	magical.	But	if	you
arrive	at	the	same	state	through	the	 _intensity	 of	 inactivity_ ,	then	it	is	a	yogic
posture,	and	it	is	a	state	that	can	be	sustained	longer.

The	very	essence	of	 _dhyana_ ,	or	meditativeness,	is	that	you	push	yourself	to
the	highest	possible	intensity	where,	after	some	time,	there	is	no	effort.	Now
meditation	will	not	be	an	act,	but	a	natural	consequence	of	the	intensity	that	has
been	 achieved.	 You	 can	 simply	 be.	 It	 is	 in	 these	 absolutely	 non-compulsive
states	of	existence	that	the	necessary	atmosphere	is	set	for	the	blossoming	of


an	individual	into	a	cosmic	possibility.

If	we,	as	societies	and	individuals,	continue	to	allow	every	moment	to	pass
by	without	setting	the	atmosphere	for	such	a	flowering,	we	have	squandered	a
tremendous	possibility.	There	is	so	much	infantile	talk	about	heaven	and	its
pleasures	only	because	the	immensity	of	being	human	has	not	been	explored.
If	your	humanity	overflows,	divinity	will	follow	and	serve	you.	It	has	no	other
choice.


**Morsel	of	the	Earth**

Your	physical	body,	as	yoga	reminds	us,	is	annamayakosha,	or	a	food	body,	just	a	heap	of	the
nourishment	you	ingest.	The	food	that	you	consume	is,	in	turn,	just	the	earth.	You	are	a	small
outcrop	of	this	planet	prancing	around	and	claiming	to	be	an	autonomous	entity.	But	since	you
are	a	small	extension	of	the	earth,	whatever	happens	to	the	planet	happens	to	you	too—in
some	subtle	and	sometimes	not-so-subtle	ways.

This	planet	is	part	of	a	larger	body	that	we	call	the	solar	system.	What	happens	to	that
system	affects	the	planet.	This	solar	system	is	part	of	a	larger	body	we	call	the	universe.
Maybe	 it	 is	 beyond	 your	 perception	 right	 now,	 but	 because	 your	 physical	 form	 is	 just	 a
fragment	of	the	planet,	everything	that	is	happening	to	any	part	of	the	universe	is	also	in	some
way	happening	to	you!

As	incredible	as	it	sounds,	if	you	maintain	your	physical	body	in	a	certain	way,	you	will
become	aware	of	subtle	changes	that	happen	in	the	planet	and	the	cosmos.	Once	you	become
sensitive	to	it,	your	whole	body	feels	everything	happening	around	you.	If	you	spend	more
time	and	pay	attention	to	the	ways	of	the	earth,	this	sensitivity	will	increase	dramatically.

I	lived	on	a	farm	for	a	few	years.	There	was	a	man	in	the	local	village	who	was	hard	of
hearing.	His	name	was	Chikkegowda.	Because	he	could	barely	hear,	he	could	not	respond	to
people,	so	they	thought	he	was	an	idiot.	He	was	rejected	by	the	village	and	made	an	object	of
ridicule.	I	employed	him	as	my	man	on	the	farm.	He	was	a	nice	companion	to	have	because	I
wasn’t	particularly	interested	in	talking,	and	he	could	not	talk	because	he	could	not	hear.	So,
no	problem!	Those	were	the	days	before	tractors;	life	on	the	farm	was	all	about	bullocks	and
ploughs.	One	day,	suddenly,	at	four	o’clock	in	the	morning,	I	saw	him	preparing	the	plough.

I	asked	him,	“What’s	happening?”
He	said,	“I	am	getting	ready	to	plough,	sir.”
I	said,	“But	what	will	you	plough?	There	is	no	rain.”
He	said,	“It	will	rain	today.”
I	looked	up.	It	was	an	absolutely	clear	sky.	I	said,	“What	nonsense!	Where	is	the	rain?”
He	said,	“No,	sir,	it	 _will_ 	rain.”
And	it	did.
I	sat	up	for	days	and	nights	after	this.	Why	couldn’t	I	feel	what	this	man	could	feel?	I	sat,
holding	my	hand	in	different	positions,	trying	to	feel	the	moisture,	the	temperature,	trying	to
read	the	sky.	I	read	all	kinds	of	books	on	meteorology,	but	it	felt	like	I	was	up	against	a	wall.
But	then,	with	careful	observation	of	my	own	body	and	what	was	around	me,	I	discovered	the
most	fundamental	mistake	that	most	of	us	make:	the	fact	that	 _we	 view	 the	 ingredients	 which_


_constitute	our	body,	like	earth,	water,	air,	and	food,	as	commodities	and	not	as	an	organic	part
of	the	life	process_.

After	persevering	for	about	eighteen	months,	I	understood.	And	now	if	I	say	it	is	going	to
rain,	ninety-five	percent	of	the	time	it	will.	This	is	not	astrology	or	magic,	but	a	surmise
based	on	the	minute	observation	of	a	completely	different	level	of	the	human	system	and	its
ongoing	transaction	with	the	planet,	the	air,	and	everything	around.	If	it	is	to	rain	today,	some
change	 _will_ 	happen	in	your	body.	Most	urban-dwellers	cannot	feel	it,	but	many	rural	people
all	over	the	world	do	sense	this.	Most	insects,	birds,	and	animals	can	feel	it.	A	tree	for	sure
knows	it.

Recognizing	these	small	changes	in	the	planetary	system,	the	ancients	tried	to	make	use	of
them	not	just	for	their	own	well-being,	but	for	transcendence.	The	magnetic	equator	of	the
planet	flows	through	India.	A	few	thousand	years	ago,	yogis	pinpointed	the	exact	location	of
the	magnetic	equator	and	built	a	whole	string	of	temples	along	this	area	for	very	specific
reasons.	One	of	the	most	famous	temples	is	the	South	Indian	temple	of	Chidambaram,	which
was	set	up	for	those	who	sought	ultimate	spiritual	union.	At	the	time	of	its	construction,	it	was
located	exactly	on	the	magnetic	equator	(which	has	since	shifted).

Many	spiritual	seekers	gathered	in	Chidambaram	over	the	centuries	at	those	times	when	the
planet	 was	 in	 a	 certain	 position.	 In	 this	 temple,	 a	 shrine	 was	 consecrated	 by	 Patanjali,	 the
father	of	yoga,	to	 _shoonya,_ 	which	literally	translates	into	“emptiness”	or	“no-thing.”	This	is
not	mere	symbolism.	At	the	magnetic	equator	there	is	no	pull	toward	north	or	south;	there	is
zero	degree	of	magnetic	play,	and	this	promotes	a	certain	balance	and	equanimity	in	the	life
of	the	spiritual	seeker.	This	equanimity	can	be	a	powerful	device	to	liberate	oneself	quite
literally	 from	 the	 limitations	 of	 the	 physical	 world,	 which	 makes	 this	 region	 the	 ideal
geographic	location	for	a	seeker.	(It	is	important	to	remember	that	the	magnetic	equator	is
distinct	from	the	geographic	equator.)

The	 additional	 significance	 of	 Chidambaram	 is	 that	 it	 happens	 to	 be	 located	 on	 eleven
degrees	latitude.	When	it	was	built,	there	was	a	convergence	of	the	magnetic	equator	with	this
latitude—a	rare	and	important	occurrence.	What	was	the	significance	of	this	location?	The	tilt
of	the	planet	at	this	latitude	impels	centrifugal	forces	in	a	nearly	vertical	direction,	which,	in
turn,	 pushes	 energy	 upward	 through	 the	 human	 physiological	 system.	 This	 means	 that	 the
ascent	 of	 human	 energy—the	 aim	 of	 the	 spiritual	 journey—is	 actually	 assisted	 by	 nature.
Since	this	was	a	great	source	of	encouragement	to	seekers,	this	entire	region	was	considered
to	be	sacred.	(It	is	not	a	coincidence	that	the	Isha	Yoga	Center	in	South	India	is	located	bang
on	eleven	degrees	latitude.)

The	kind	of	spiritual	system	described	above	makes	use	of	natural	phenomena	to	support
human	 efforts	 at	 spiritual	 growth.	 Another	 system—of	 meditativeness,	 or	 inwardness—
completely	 ignores	 the	 changes	 happening	 in	 creation	 and	 focuses	 solely	 on	 the	 inner
journey.	 These	 are	 the	 two	 fundamental	 ways	 in	 which	 the	 spiritual	 journey	 can	 be
approached:	you	can	either	go	slowly,	step-by-step,	accepting	all	natural	assistance	available
to	 you,	 or	 you	 can	 ignore	 all	 the	 steps	 and	 take	 the	 inward	 leap.	 The	 second	 entails	 a
withdrawal	 from	 external	 life	 situations;	 the	 first	 makes	 involvement	 mandatory.	 Every


human	being	is	free	to	choose	the	path	more	suitable	to	his	or	her	temperament.	In	the	times
in	which	we	live,	a	balance	between	the	two	is	usually	best.

Sadhana

```
The	body	responds	the	moment	it	is	in	touch	with	the	earth.	That	is	why	spiritual	people	in	India	walked
barefoot	and	always	sat	on	the	ground	in	a	posture	that	allowed	for	maximum	area	of	contact	with	the
earth.	In	this	way,	the	body	is	given	a	strong	experiential	reminder	that	it	is	just	a	part	of	this	earth.	Never	is
the	 body	 allowed	 to	 forget	 its	 origins.	 When	 it	 is	 allowed	 to	 forget,	 it	 often	 starts	 making	 fanciful
demands;	 when	 it	 is	 constantly	 reminded,	 it	 knows	 its	 place.	 This	 contact	 with	 the	 earth	 is	 a	 vital
reconnection	of	the	body	with	its	physical	source.	This	restores	stability	to	the	system	and	enhances	the
human	capacity	for	rejuvenation	greatly.	This	explains	why	there	are	so	many	people	who	claim	that	their
lives	have	been	magically	transformed	just	by	taking	up	a	simple	outdoor	activity	like	gardening.
Today,	 the	 many	 artificial	 ways	 in	 which	 we	 distance	 ourselves	 from	 the	 earth—in	 the	 form	 of
pavements	and	multi-storied	structures,	or	even	the	widespread	trend	of	wearing	high	heels—involves	an
alienation	of	the	part	from	the	whole	and	suffocates	the	fundamental	life	process.	This	alienation	manifests
in	large-scale	autoimmune	disorders	and	chronic	allergic	conditions.
If	you	tend	to	fall	sick	very	easily,	you	could	just	try	sleeping	on	the	floor	(or	with	minimal	organic
separation	between	yourself	and	the	floor).	You	will	see	it	will	make	a	big	difference.	Also,	try	sitting
closer	to	the	ground.	Additionally,	if	you	can	find	a	tree	that	looks	lively	to	you,	in	terms	of	an	abundance
of	fresh	leaves	or	flowers,	go	spend	some	time	around	it.	If	possible,	have	your	breakfast	or	lunch	under
that	tree.	As	you	sit	under	the	tree,	remind	yourself:	“This	very	earth	is	my	body.	I	take	this	body	from	the
earth	and	give	it	back	to	the	earth.	I	consciously	ask	Mother	Earth	now	to	sustain	me,	hold	me,	keep	me
well.”	You	will	find	your	body’s	ability	to	recover	is	greatly	enhanced.
Or	if	you	have	turned	all	your	trees	into	furniture,	collect	some	fresh	soil	and	cover	your	feet	and	hands
with	it.	Stay	that	way	for	twenty	to	thirty	minutes.	This	could	help	your	recovery	significantly.

**In	Sync	with	the	Sun**

The	 _surya	namaskar_ 	is	a	familiar	sequence	of	postures	to	many	who	have	practiced	or	know
something	of	yoga.	Generally,	people	understand	the	surya	namaskar	as	a	physical	exercise.
Others	view	it	with	some	suspicion	as	some	form	of	sun	worship.	It	is	neither.	Yes,	it	most
definitely	does	strengthen	your	spine	and	muscles	and	more,	but	that	is	not	the	objective.

What	then	is	the	significance	of	what	is	often	seen	as	a	sun	salutation?
Firstly,	this	is	not	a	salutation	at	all.	It	literally	means	organizing	the	solar	energies	within
you,	based	on	the	simple	logic	that	all	life	on	this	Earth	is	solar-powered.	The	sun	is	the	life
source	for	this	planet.	In	everything	that	you	eat,	drink,	and	breathe,	there	is	an	element	of	the
sun.	Only	if	you	learn	how	to	better	“digest”	the	sun—internalize	it,	and	integrate	it	into	your
system—do	you	truly	benefit	from	this	process.

Those	who	do	surya	namaskars	regularly	find	that	their	batteries	last	longer,	with	less	need
for	 recharge	 or	 replenishment.	 Additionally,	 the	 surya	 namaskar	 aids	 the	 balance	 or
reorganization	of	inner	energies,	in	terms	of	right	and	left,	or	lunar	and	solar	dimensions.
This	produces	an	innate	physical	and	psychological	equilibrium	that	can	be	an	enormous	asset
in	one’s	daily	life.

As	I	mentioned	before,	when	I	was	young,	I	had	to	be	forcibly	awakened	every	morning	by
my	mother.	But	once	I	began	yoga,	my	system	came	awake	effortlessly	at	a	certain	hour	every
day.	Life	began	to	happen	with	that	much	more	ease	and	equanimity.

The	 surya	 namaskar	 is	 essentially	 about	 building	 a	 dimension	 within	 you	 where	 your
physical	bodily	cycles	are	in	sync	with	the	sun’s	cycles,	which	run	about	twelve	and	a	quarter
years.	It	is	not	by	accident	but	by	intent	that	it	has	been	structured	with	twelve	postures.	If	your
system	is	in	a	certain	level	of	vibrancy	and	readiness,	and	in	a	high	state	of	receptivity,	then
naturally	your	cycle	will	be	in	sync	with	the	solar	cycle.

Young	women	have	an	advantage	because	they	are	also	in	sync	with	the	lunar	cycles.	It	is	an
advantage,	but	a	lot	of	them	treat	it	as	a	curse.	It	is	a	fantastic	possibility	that	your	body	is	both
connected	to	the	solar	 _and_ 	the	lunar	cycles.	Nature	has	granted	this	advantage	to	a	woman
because	she	has	been	entrusted	with	the	responsibility	of	propagating	the	human	race.	So	she
has	been	given	some	extra	privileges,	which	unfortunately	have	been	perceived	socially	as
disadvantages.	People	do	not	know	how	to	handle	the	bonus	energy	generated	at	that	time	and
hence	treat	it	as	a	curse,	and	even	a	kind	of	madness.	(The	word	“lunatic”	is	derived,	as	we
know,	from	“lunar.”)

The	physical	body	is	a	fantastic	stepping-stone	for	higher	possibilities,	but	for	most	people
it	functions	as	a	roadblock.	The	compulsions	of	the	body	do	not	allow	them	to	go	forward.
Practicing	 surya	 namaskar	 maintains	 physical	 balance	 and	 receptivity,	 and	 is	 a	 means	 of
taking	the	body	to	the	edge,	so	that	it	is	not	a	hurdle.


Between	the	menstrual	cycle,	which	is	the	shortest	cycle	(a	twenty-eight-day	cycle),	and	the
cycle	of	the	sun,	which	is	over	twelve	years,	there	are	many	other	kinds	of	cycles.	The	word
“cyclical”	denotes	repetition.	It	also	means	going	round	in	circles	and	not	getting	anywhere.
Repetition	means,	on	some	level,	compulsion.	Compulsiveness	implies	something	that	is	not
conducive	for	consciousness.

Anything	that	is	physical,	from	the	atomic	to	the	cosmic,	is	cyclical.	Either	you	ride	the
cycle	or	are	crushed	by	it.	Yogic	practice	is	always	aimed	at	enabling	you	to	ride	the	cycle,	so
you	have	the	right	kind	of	foundation	for	consciousness.

It	must	be	remembered	that	the	repetitive	nature	of	cyclical	movements	or	systems,	which
we	traditionally	refer	to	as	 _samsara,_ 	offers	the	necessary	stability	for	the	making	of	life.	If
everything	was	random,	it	would	not	be	possible	to	house	a	steady	life-making	machine.	For
the	 solar	 system	 and	 for	 the	 individual,	 being	 rooted	 in	 cyclical	 nature	 gives	 a	 certain
firmness	and	steadiness	to	life.	The	very	nature	of	the	physical	world	 _is_ 	cyclical.

But	once	life	has	reached	the	level	of	evolution	that	human	beings	have	attained,	it	is	natural
to	aspire	not	just	to	stability,	but	to	transcendence.	Now,	it	is	left	to	individual	human	beings
either	to	remain	trapped	in	the	cyclical,	or	to	use	these	cycles	for	physical	well-being,	or
finally	to	go	beyond	the	cyclical	entirely.

If	you	are	compulsive,	you	will	see	that	situations,	experiences,	thoughts,	and	emotions	in
your	life	will	be	in	cycles.	They	keep	coming	back	to	you	once	every	six	or	eighteen	months,
three	years,	or	six	years,	depending	on	your	degree	of	compulsiveness.	If	you	just	look	back
on	your	life,	you	will	notice	this.	If	they	come	once	every	twelve	years,	that	means	your
system	is	in	a	high	state	of	receptivity	and	balance.

The	surya	namaskar	is	an	important	process	to	enable	that	to	happen.	On	a	rudimentary
level,	 it	 is	 a	 complete	 workout	 for	 the	 physical	 system—a	 comprehensive	 exercise	 form
without	any	need	for	equipment.	But	above	all,	it	is	an	important	tool	that	empowers	human
beings	to	break	free	from	the	compulsive	patterns	of	their	lives.

There	are	variations	of	this	practice,	depending	on	an	individual’s	aspirations.	Someone
who	 seeks	 muscular	 fitness	 can	 practice	 a	 basic	 process	 that	 is	 known	 as	 _surya	 shakti_.
Through	practice,	if	one	attains	a	certain	level	of	stability	and	mastery	over	the	system,	one
could	be	introduced	to	a	more	powerful	and	spiritually	significant	process	called	the	 _surya
kriya_ .	While	the	surya	namaskar	is	about	balancing	the	two	dimensions	of	sun	and	moon	(or
masculine	and	feminine)	within	the	human	system,	the	surya	kriya	is	about	connecting	these
two	fundamental	divisions	for	further	spiritual	growth.


```
A	LEGENDARY	YOGI
```
Raghavendra	Rao,	the	yoga	teacher	I	met	as	a	boy,	led	a	life	that	would	be
considered	 superhuman	 by	 conventional	 standards.	 He	 was	 known	 as
Malladihalli	Swami	because	he	hailed	from	the	village	of	Malladihalli,	which
is	in	the	southwestern	Indian	state	of	Karnataka.

He	was	known	to	do	1,008	surya	namaskars	a	day.	Later,	after	he	was	ninety
years	 of	 age,	 he	 brought	 the	 number	 down	 to	 108	 (not	 because	 he	 wasn’t
capable,	but	because	there	was	no	time).	That	was	his	spiritual	practice.

In	addition	to	being	a	yoga	master,	he	was	a	wonderful	Ayurvedic	doctor.
He	 was	 one	 of	 the	 few	 _nadi	 vaidyas_ —traditional	 physicians	 who	 diagnose
your	ailment	by	feeling	your	pulse.	He	would	not	only	tell	you	what	disease
you	had	today,	but	could	predict	what	ailment	was	likely	to	afflict	you	in	the
next	ten	to	fifteen	years,	and	would	teach	the	requisite	remedial	practices.	One
day	in	a	week,	he	would	be	available	in	his	ashram	as	an	Ayurvedic	doctor.
Wherever	he	was,	he	would	travel	back	to	the	ashram	on	Sunday	evening	to	be
there	on	Monday	morning.	If	he	sat	down	at	four	o’clock	in	the	morning,	he
was	 there	 right	 through	 the	 day	 till	 seven	 or	 eight	 o’clock	 in	 the	 evening.
Volunteers	would	come	in	shifts	to	help	him,	but	he	himself	sat	through	the
whole	day.	For	every	patient	who	came,	he	had	a	joke	to	tell.	People	would
forget	they	had	come	for	treatment.	It	was	less	like	a	doctor-patient	interaction
and	more	of	a	festival!

This	happened	when	he	was	about	eighty-three	years	of	age:	One	Sunday,
late	at	night,	he	was	at	a	railway	station	about	forty-six	miles	from	his	ashram.
He	was	with	two	companions,	and	they	discovered	that	there	was	a	railway
strike.	This	meant	no	trains	and	no	other	means	of	transport.	His	commitment
to	his	work	was	such	that	he	left	his	two	companions	on	the	platform	and	just
ran	forty-six	miles	overnight	on	the	railway	tracks!

At	 four	 o’clock	 in	 the	 morning	 he	 was	 at	 the	 ashram,	 ready	 to	 treat	 his
patients.	People	at	the	ashram	did	not	even	realize	that	he	had	come	running.
Only	when	his	other	two	friends	reached	there	did	they	tell	the	others	what
Swamiji	had	done!	That	is	how	incredibly	he	lived.	He	lived	up	to	the	age	of	a
hundred	and	six	and	taught	yoga	until	his	dying	day.


**Elemental	Mischief**

Life	is	a	game	of	just	five	ingredients.	Even	a	pizza	requires	more	ingredients!	But	in	yoga
both	the	human	body	and	the	cosmos	are	based	on	the	magic	of	only	five	elements—earth,
water,	fire,	air,	and	ether.	Such	a	staggeringly	complex	phenomenon	and	just	five	variables!
Not	surprisingly,	those	who	attained	self-realization	have	often	termed	life	a	cosmic	joke.

Once,	when	I	was	driving	after	midnight,	I	approached	a	mountain.	As	I	drove	toward	it,	I
saw	that	almost	half	the	mountain	was	ablaze!	I	am	not	known	to	shy	away	from	danger,	so	I
continued	to	drive.	But	I	was	cautious,	because	I	knew	I	was	in	a	car	full	of	flammable	fuel
and	I	had	my	little	girl	in	the	backseat.	It	was	misty	and	the	farther	I	drove	up	the	mountain,	the
fire	always	seemed	to	be	a	little	farther	away.	Then	I	realized	that	although	all	the	terrain	that	I
saw	from	down	below	looked	like	it	was	on	fire,	as	I	drove	into	it,	there	was	nothing	at	all.

When	I	reached	the	actual	site	of	the	fire,	I	saw	that	a	truck	had	broken	down.	The	driver
and	a	couple	of	others	had	built	a	small	fire	for	themselves	because	of	the	cold.	As	the	mist
reached	dew	point,	the	million	droplets	in	the	air,	each	one	acting	as	a	prism,	created	such	a
phenomenal	illusion	that	a	little	fire	seemed	like	a	major	conflagration.	From	down	below,	it
looked	like	the	whole	mountain	was	aflame!	That	incident	left	me	astounded.

Creation	 is	 just	 like	 that,	 hugely	 magnified.	 Those	 who	 have	 looked	 within	 themselves
closely	and	attentively	realized	there	was	no	need	to	look	at	the	macro	version.	The	entire
cosmos	is	just	a	magnified	projection	of	a	little	occurrence	happening	within	you—the	play
of	five	elements.	This	is	all	it	takes	to	make	a	throbbing	full-fledged	human	being!

Maybe	your	desire	is	individual	or	maybe	it	is	universal.	But	whether	you	want	to	realize
the	full	potential	of	this	human	mechanism	or	merge	with	the	larger	cosmic	mechanism,	you
need	a	certain	measure	of	mastery	over	these	five	elements.	Without	this	you	know	neither	the
pleasure	of	being	an	individual	nor	the	bliss	of	uniting	with	the	cosmic.

Whether	your	physical	body	is	a	stepping-stone	or	a	hurdle	on	your	path	to	well-being,
essentially	depends	on	how	you	are	able	to	manage	these	five.	If	they	do	not	cooperate	with
each	other,	nothing	significant	ever	happens	to	you.	But	with	their	cooperation,	your	life—
from	the	basic	to	the	highest	aspects—suddenly	becomes	a	tremendous	possibility.

The	body	is	like	a	doorway.	If	you	are	always	facing	closed	doors,	then	for	you	a	door
means	a	deterrent.	If	doors	are	always	opening	up	for	you,	then	for	you	a	door	means	a
possibility.	They	say	how	long	a	minute	is	essentially	depends	on	which	side	of	the	bathroom
door	you	are!	Those	inside	say,	“Just	a	minute,	I’m	coming.”	That	one	minute,	for	the	person
outside,	is	an	eternity!

Every	 spiritual	 practice	 in	 the	 world	 is	 related	 in	 some	 way	 with	 organizing	 these	 five
elements.	The	most	fundamental	practice	in	the	yogic	system	is	 _bhuta	shuddhi_ —the	cleansing


of	the	elements	in	the	physical	system	so	that	they	work	in	harmony.	All	yogic	practices	are
essentially	derived	from	the	cleansing	of	these	elements.	The	basis	of	individual	existence	is
actually	memory,	which	penetrates	deep	into	these	five	elements.	Cleansing	the	elements	of
the	 compulsive	 tendencies	 that	 percolate	 into	 the	 individual	 as	 a	 result	 of	 mental,	 genetic,
evolutionary,	 and	 karmic	 memory,	 helps	 bring	 a	 sense	 of	 absolute	 harmony	 between	 the
individual	and	the	cosmos.	(We	will	look	at	the	role	of	memory	at	greater	length	in	a	later
chapter.)

When	you	achieve	a	level	of	expertise	in	your	yogic	practice,	you	approach	what	is	called
_bhuta	siddhi,_ 	or	mastery	over	the	elements.	With	this	mastery,	life	opens	up	its	bounty	to	you.
Health,	well-being,	clarity,	enlightenment—none	of	these	can	be	denied	to	you	anymore.

So	whether	you	experience	life	as	a	great	possibility	or	a	great	barrier	simply	depends	on
the	extent	to	which	these	five	elements	cooperate	with	you.	Freedom	and	bondage—both	are
determined	by	these	five	elements.	The	very	existence	that	traps	you	also	sustains	you.	This	is
the	paradox	of	the	life	process.	Love	and	hate,	freedom	and	entrapment,	life	and	death	are	all
encapsulated	in	each	other.	If	they	were	separate,	there	would	be	no	problem;	you	could	deal
with	them.	The	problem	is,	they	are	inextricable.	If	you	try	to	avoid	life,	you	only	end	up
avoiding	death!

In	ancient	India,	there	were	courtesans	who	were	masters	in	the	art	of	seduction.	They	wore
elaborate	 jewelry	 that	 seemed	 impossible	 to	 remove.	 The	 whole	 body	 was	 covered	 in
ornaments.	If	you	had	to	take	them	off	one	by	one,	it	would	take	a	long	time.	The	man,	fired
up	 by	 lust,	 would	 want	 to	 undress	 this	 woman,	 but	 it	 was	 in	 vain.	 She	 would	 go	 on
encouraging	him	with	more	intoxicants—a	little	more,	a	little	more,	and	a	little	more.	As	his
vision	 grew	 blurry,	 his	 task	 grew	 even	 more	 difficult,	 and	 eventually,	 he	 would	 fall	 fast
asleep,	snoring.	But	there	was	just	one	pin;	all	it	took	was	to	pull	this	one	pin,	and	everything
would	fall	down.	That	trick	only	 _she_ 	knew.

Life	is	a	bit	like	that.	It	is	a	complex	web,	but	there	is	one	simple	pin.	And	that	is	your
identity.	The	play	of	five	elements	is	highly	evolved	and	complicated,	but	the	key	to	freedom
is	your	limited	persona.	If	you	pull	the	plug,	it	just	falls	apart	and	you	are	free.	If	you	know
how	to	pull	yourself	out,	life’s	complexity	collapses	and	everything	settles.	The	simplicity	of
perfect	alignment	with	existence	is	suddenly	yours.

Sadhana

```
The	simplest	thing	that	you	can	do	to	change	the	health	and	fundamental	structure	of	your	body	is	to	treat
the	five	elements	with	devotion	and	respect.	Just	try	this.	Every	time	you	are	consciously	in	touch	with	any
of	the	elements	(which	you	are	every	moment	of	your	life),	just	make	a	conscious	attempt	to	refer	to	it	in
terms	of	whatever	you	consider	to	be	the	ultimate	or	the	loftiest	ideal	in	your	life,	whether	it	is	Shiva,
Rama,	Krishna,	God,	Allah	(or	even	Marx!).	You	are	a	psychological	being	right	now,	and	your	mind	is
full	of	hierarchy.	This	process	will	settle	the	hierarchy.	After	some	time,	the	word	can	fall	away.	But	you
instantly	see	the	change	as	the	number	of	truly	conscious	moments	in	your	life	increases.	The	air	that	you
```

breathe,	the	food	that	you	eat,	the	water	that	you	drink,	the	land	that	you	walk	upon,	and	the	very	space
that	holds	you—every	one	of	them	offers	you	a	divine	possibility.


```
ENSHRINING	THE	ELEMENTS
```
In	southern	India,	five	major	temples	were	built	for	each	of	the	five	elements.
These	temples	were	created	not	for	worship	but	to	facilitate	a	specific	type	of
spiritual	practice.

To	cleanse	the	water	element	you	would	go	to	a	particular	temple	and	do
one	kind	of	practice.	To	cleanse	the	element	of	air,	you	would	go	to	another.	In
this	manner,	five	wonderful	temples	were	created	for	each	of	the	elements,
infused	 with	 the	 kind	 of	 energy	 that	 assisted	 a	 particular	 type	 of	 spiritual
practice.	 Traditionally,	 seekers	 traveled	 from	 one	 temple	 to	 another,	 to	 be
initiated	into	practices	that	enabled	them	to	have	mastery	over	the	elements	and
to	achieve	healing,	well-being,	and	even	transcendence.

These	five	temples	were	built	so	that	they	functioned	as	one	system.	This
was	 a	 phenomenal	 technology.	 Those	 who	 knew	 the	 appropriate	 spiritual
practice	 could	 make	 use	 of	 it.	 Those	 who	 did	 not	 know	 the	 practice	 could
benefit	just	by	living	in	that	region.	The	temples	still	exist,	and	even	those	who
do	not	understand	their	energy	significance	marvel	at	these	magnificent	works
of	architecture.


**When	the	Shit	Hit	the	Ceiling**

Once	it	happened...One	day	in	court	the	emperor	Akbar	asked,	“What	do	you	think	gives	the
most	pleasure	to	a	person?”

There	was	a	chorus	of	responses.	One	courtier	said,	“Serving	God	is	the	greatest	pleasure,
Your	Highness.”

There	are	always	all	manner	of	sycophants	around	emperors.	So	someone	else	said,	“Oh
my	lord,	serving	you	is	the	greatest	pleasure	I	can	conceive	of!”

A	third	courtier	said,	“Just	gazing	at	your	face	is	the	ultimate	joy!”
The	hyperbole	poured	forth.	Birbal,	the	wise,	just	sat	there,	bored.
Akbar	 asked,	 “Birbal,	 what	 makes	 you	 so	 silent?	 What	 is	 it	 that	 gives	 _you_ the	 greatest
pleasure?”

Birbal	said,	“Shitting.”
Until	then,	Akbar	was	feeling	great	with	all	the	fawning	and	adoration.	Now	he	got	mad.	He
said,	“For	uttering	such	an	obscenity	in	court,	you	had	better	prove	it.	If	you	can’t	prove	it,
your	life	is	at	risk.”

Birbal	said,	“Give	me	a	fortnight,	Your	Highness.	I’ll	prove	it	to	you.”
Akbar	said,	“Fine.”
The	next	weekend,	Birbal	organized	a	hunting	trip	for	Akbar	into	the	forest,	and	made	sure
all	the	women	in	the	palace	also	traveled	on	this	expedition.	He	set	up	the	camp	in	such	a	way
that	Akbar’s	tent	was	in	the	center.	All	around,	he	placed	the	families,	women	and	children.	He
told	the	catering	department	to	produce	the	best	food.	They	produced	the	choicest	delicacies
and	Akbar	ate	well.	He	was	on	a	vacation,	after	all.

The	next	morning	when	he	got	up	and	came	out,	he	saw	that	there	was	no	toilet	tent.	He
went	back	into	his	tent	and	walked	up	and	down,	but	the	pressure	was	building	up.	He	tried	to
go	into	the	forest,	but	Birbal	had	made	sure	the	womenfolk	were	all	over	the	place.

Pressure	 built	 up	 by	 the	 minute.	 It	 was	 about	 twelve	 noon,	 and	 Akbar	 couldn’t	 bear	 it
anymore.	He	was	just	about	to	burst.	Birbal,	who	was	watching	this	whole	scene,	kept	walking
around,	 muttering,	 “Toilet	 tent,	 where	 to	 put	 it,	 where	 to	 put	 it?”	 He	 was	 simply	 creating
confusion	and	delaying	matters	a	little	longer.

The	emperor	was	full	of	shit,	and	just	when	there	was	no	more	time	left,	they	managed	to
set	up	the	toilet	tent.	Akbar	went	inside	and	moaned	with	relief.	Then	Birbal,	who	was	waiting
for	him	outside	the	tent,	asked,	“Do	you	agree	with	me	now?”

```
Akbar	said,	“It	 is 	the	greatest	pleasure.”
```

Relief	from	something	that	you	cannot	hold	within	you	is	always	the	greatest	pleasure,	isn’t
it?	Whatever	that	thing	may	be!

So,	the	body	 _can_ 	become	an	issue.	A	big	issue.	A	barrier	between	you	and	your	enjoyment
of	life.

If	you	want	to	maintain	the	body	in	a	certain	way,	it	is	important	to	pay	attention	to	the
various	activities	of	the	body,	in	relation	to	food,	sleep,	and	sex.	We	will	look	at	each	of	these
in	turn	in	the	next	few	pages.

Sadhana

```
It	is	important	not	to	keep	eating	through	the	day.	If	you	are	below	thirty	years	of	age,	three	meals	every
day	will	fit	well	into	your	life.	If	you	are	over	thirty	years	of	age,	it	is	best	to	reduce	it	to	two	meals	per
day.	Our	body	and	brain	work	at	their	best	only	when	the	stomach	is	empty.	So	be	conscious	of	eating	in
such	a	way	that	within	two	and	a	half	hours,	your	food	moves	out	of	the	stomach,	and	within	twelve	to
eighteen	hours	completely	out	of	the	system.	With	this	simple	awareness	you	will	experience	much	more
energy,	 agility,	 and	 alertness.	 These	 are	 the	 ingredients	 of	 a	 successful	 life,	 irrespective	 of	 what	 you
choose	to	do	with	it.
```

**Food	as	Fuel**

Your	physical	body	is	just	an	accumulation	of	food.	Yoga	pays	much	attention	to	food	because
what	kind	of	food	you	put	into	the	system	has	a	tremendous	impact	on	the	kind	of	body	you
have	constructed.	There	is	a	whole	yogic	science	behind	what	to	eat,	how	to	eat,	and	when	to
eat.	What	kind	of	stuff	you	put	into	it	determines	the	quality	of	the	body	and	how	comfortable
it	is	with	itself.

Are	you	preparing	this	body	to	run	as	swiftly	as	a	cheetah?	Or	are	you	preparing	this	body
to	carry	two	hundred	pounds?	Or	are	you	preparing	this	body	so	that	it	becomes	conducive
for	higher	meditative	possibilities?	You	need	to	eat	the	right	kind	of	food	depending	on	your
inclination	and	what	you	want	out	of	your	life.

The	way	you	eat	not	only	decides	your	physical	health,	but	the	very	way	you	think,	feel,	and
experience	life.	Trying	to	eat	intelligently	means	understanding	what	kind	of	fuel	this	body	is
designed	for	and	accordingly	supplying	it,	so	that	it	functions	at	its	best.

Let	us	say	you	bought	a	gasoline	car,	but	pumped	diesel	into	it.	It	might	still	move	around,
but	it	would	not	function	at	its	optimal	capacity,	and	its	life	span	would	also	be	substantially
reduced.	Similarly,	if	we	do	not	understand	what	kind	of	fuel	this	body	is	designed	for,	if	we
just	force	whatever	comes	onto	our	plate	into	our	systems,	it	will	definitely	not	function	at	its
optimum	capacity	and	its	longevity	could	be	seriously	compromised.	The	compatibility	of	the
fuel	and	the	machine	is	of	great	importance	if	you	are	seeking	a	certain	caliber	of	service.

What	kind	of	food	is	the	human	system	really	designed	for?
If	you	eat	certain	foods,	the	body	becomes	happy.	If	you	eat	certain	other	foods,	the	body
turns	dull	and	lethargic,	and	your	sleep	quota	increases.	If	you	sleep	for	eight	hours	a	day,	and
you	live	a	hundred	years,	you	have	spent	one	third	of	your	life	sleeping!	Another	thirty	to
forty	percent	is	spent	on	food,	toilet,	and	other	ablutions.	There	is	very	little	time	left	for	life!

You	eat	food	for	energy,	but	if	you	eat	a	big	meal,	do	you	feel	energetic	or	lethargic?
Depending	upon	the	quality	of	the	food	that	you	eat,	you	first	feel	lethargy,	and	then	slowly
you	start	feeling	energetic.

Why	is	this	so?
One	aspect	is	the	fact	that	your	system	cannot	digest	cooked	food	as	it	is;	it	needs	certain
enzymes	to	do	so.	All	the	enzymes	necessary	for	the	digestive	process	are	not	present	in	the
body	 alone;	 the	 food	 that	 you	 eat	 also	 contains	 these	 enzymes.	 When	 you	 cook	 the	 food,
generally	eighty	to	ninety	percent	of	the	enzymes	are	destroyed.	So	the	body	is	struggling	to
reconstitute	these	destroyed	enzymes.	The	enzymes	that	you	destroy	in	cooking	can	never	be
totally	re-constituted,	so	generally,	for	most	human	beings,	about	fifty	percent	of	the	food	that
they	eat	becomes	waste.

```
Another	aspect	is	the	stress	on	the	system.	The	body	has	to	process	all	this	food	just	to	get	a
```

small	quota	of	energy	for	its	daily	activity.	If	we	ate	foods	with	the	necessary	enzymes,	the
system	would	be	functioning	at	a	completely	different	level	of	efficiency	and	the	conversion
ratio	 of	 food	 to	 energy	 would	 be	 very	 different.	 Eating	 natural	 foods,	 in	 their	 uncooked
condition,	when	the	cells	are	still	alive,	will	bring	an	enormous	sense	of	health	and	vitality	to
the	system.

One	can	easily	experiment	with	this.	Don’t	ask	your	doctor,	your	nutritionist,	or	your	yoga
teacher.	When	it	comes	to	food,	it	is	about	the	body.	Ask	the	body	what	kind	of	food	it	is	most
comfortable	with,	not	your	tongue.	The	kind	of	food	your	body	feels	most	comfortable	with
is	always	the	ideal	food	to	eat.	You	must	learn	to	listen	to	your	body.	As	your	body	awareness
evolves,	you	will	know	exactly	what	a	certain	food	will	do	to	you.	You	do	not	even	have	to	put
it	into	your	mouth.	You	can	develop	this	kind	of	heightened	sensitivity	whereby	just	looking	at
or	touching	the	food	will	be	enough	for	you	to	know	its	potential	impact	on	your	system.

Sadhana

```
You	 can	 experiment:	 arrange	 the	 best	 possible	 meal	 for	 yourself,	 get	 angry	 with	 something,	 curse	 the
whole	 world,	 and	 then	 eat	 it.	 You	 will	 see	 that	 day	 how	 food	 behaves	 within	 you.	 At	 the	 next	 meal,
approach	your	food	with	the	reverence	that	the	life-making	material	deserves	and	eat	it.	You	will	now	see
how	 it	 will	 behave	 within	 you.	 (Of	 course,	 if	 you’re	 sensible,	 you’ll	 ignore	 the	 first	 and	 only	 do	 the
second!)
Most	people	can	bring	down	the	quantum	of	food	they	are	eating	to	a	third	and	be	much	more	energetic
and	 not	 lose	 weight.	 It	 is	 just	 a	 question	 of	 how	 much	 receptivity	 you	 have	 created	 within	 yourself.
Accordingly	 your	 body	 receives.	 If	 you	 can	 do	 the	 same	 amount	 of	 work,	 maintain	 all	 the	 bodily
processes,	with	thirty	percent	of	the	food	that	you	eat,	that	definitely	means	you	are	running	a	much	more
efficient	machine.
```

```
IN	A	NUTSHELL
```
The	 pranic	 value	 of	 all	 seeds	 is	 tremendous,	 because	 they	 represent
concentrated	life.	This	is	quite	apart	from	their	enormous	nutritional	value.
What	 you	 call	 a	 nut	 is	 essentially	 just	 a	 seed,	 and	 a	 seed	 is	 a	 wonderful
possibility.	A	seed	is	the	future	of	a	plant’s	life.	A	single	seed	is	capable	of
making	 the	 entire	 Earth	 green.	 Consequently,	 consuming	 anything	 in	 seed
form	can	greatly	enhance	human	health	on	many	levels.

As	far	as	possible,	soak	the	nuts	that	you	intend	to	consume	in	water	for	six
to	eight	hours,	especially	if	they	are	dry	nuts.	All	seeds	have	a	certain	natural
chemical	self-protection.	Soaking	in	water	will	flush	out	these	toxic	substances
and	bring	them	to	the	surface,	and	these	can	be	eliminated	by	peeling	off	the
skin	 of	 the	 nut.	 Additionally,	 soaking	 them	 helps	 lower	 the	 concentrated
protein	content	which	sometimes	makes	them	difficult	to	digest.


**Hell’s	Kitchen**

There	is	an	ongoing	debate	between	the	proponents	of	vegetarianism	and	non-vegetarianism.
I	am	often	asked	which	is	better.

Vegetarians	are	often	inclined	to	act	holier-than-thou,	while	non-vegetarians	often	claim
they	are	more	robust	and	fit	for	the	world,	given	that	they	are	willing	to	include	all	the	species
on	the	planet	on	their	menu.	Great	philosophies	have	evolved	based	on	food	choices.

In	yoga,	there	is	absolutely	nothing	religious,	philosophical,	spiritual,	or	moral	about	the
food	that	we	eat.	It	is	only	a	question	of	whether	the	food	is	compatible	with	the	kind	of	body
that	we	own.

This	compatibility	depends	on	various	ends.	If	being	big	is	your	highest	aspiration,	then
certain	types	of	foods	have	to	be	consumed.	If	you	want	a	body	that	supports	a	particular	level
of	intelligence,	or	if	you	want	a	body	with	a	certain	level	of	alertness,	awareness,	and	agility,
other	types	of	foods	must	be	consumed.	If	you	are	not	someone	who	will	settle	just	for	health
and	the	pleasures	of	life,	but	want	a	body	perceptive	enough	to	download	the	cosmos,	you	will
need	to	eat	in	a	very	different	way.	Depending	on	your	aspiration,	you	will	accordingly	have
to	manage	your	diet.	Or	if	your	aspirations	involve	all	these	dimensions,	you	will	have	to	find
a	suitable	balance.

Keeping	aside	our	personal	goals	and	aspirations,	what	type	of	fuel	is	this	body	designed
for?	 This	 is	 something	 to	 which	 all	 of	 us	 should	 first	 pay	 attention.	 Modifications,
adjustments,	 and	 adaptations	 of	 diet	 should	 come	 later.	 If	 it	 is	 simply	 a	 question	 of	 basic
survival,	eat	whatever	you	want.	But	once	survival	is	taken	care	of	and	there	is	a	choice,	it	is
important	that	you	eat	consciously,	and	are	led	not	by	the	compulsion	of	the	tongue	but	by	the
essential	design	of	your	body.

In	the	animal	kingdom,	you	can	largely	classify	animals	as	herbivores	and	carnivores—
those	 that	 eat	 vegetable	 matter	 and	 those	 that	 consume	 meat	 or	 prey	 upon	 other	 animals.
Between	these	two	categories	of	creatures,	there	are	fundamental	differences	in	the	design	and
construction	of	their	physical	systems.	Since	our	focus	is	food,	let	us	explore	the	digestive
systems	of	each.	The	whole	alimentary	canal	is	a	digestive	tract	from	the	lip	to	the	anal	outlet.
If	 you	 travel	 down	 this	 tube,	 you	 will	 find	 some	 very	 fundamental	 differences	 between
herbivores	and	carnivores.	Consider	a	few	significant	ones.

For	one,	you	will	find	that	carnivores	are	capable	of	only	a	cutting	action	in	their	jaws,	but
the	herbivores	are	capable	of	both	cutting	and	grinding	actions.	We	human	beings	have	both
cutting	and	grinding	actions.

```
What	is	the	reason	for	this	design	difference?
```

Suppose	you	take	a	bit	of	uncooked	rice	and	place	it	in	your	mouth	for	a	minute	or	more,
you	will	notice	that	it	turns	sweet.	This	sweetness	is	happening	because	right	there	in	your
mouth	 carbohydrates	 are	 getting	 converted	 into	 sugar	 (an	 essential	 part	 of	 the	 digestive
process)	by	an	enzyme	called	“ptyalin,”	which	is	in	your	saliva.	Ptyalin	is	present	in	the	saliva
of	all	herbivores,	but	not	in	carnivores.	So	carnivores	just	have	to	cut	their	food	into	smaller
pieces	 and	 swallow	 it,	 while	 herbivores	 have	 to	 chew	 their	 food.	 Mastication	 involves
grinding	and	then	thoroughly	mixing	the	food	with	the	saliva;	hence	the	design	modification
in	the	jaw.

If	mastication	happens	properly,	close	to	fifty	percent	of	your	digestive	process	would	be
finished	in	the	mouth.	In	other	words,	the	stomach	region	is	expecting	partially	digested	food
to	efficiently	complete	the	process.	In	modern	life,	people	are	in	such	a	hurry	that	we	gulp	our
rush-hour	lunches	without	the	food	being	properly	masticated.

The	stomach	is	burdened	not	only	with	undigested	food,	but	also	with	partially	destroyed
food.	Today’s	kitchens	have	largely	become	places	where	food	is	efficiently	destroyed.	Food
that	 is	 nutritious	 and	 full	 of	 life	 is	 systematically	 degraded	 through	 the	 cooking	 process,
which	depletes	its	nutritional	value	and	largely	obliterates	its	pranic	value	(its	capacity	to	be
spiritually	supportive).

Next,	if	you	look	at	the	length	of	the	alimentary	canal,	for	herbivores	it	is	generally	about
five	to	six	times	the	length	of	their	bodies.	In	carnivores,	it	ranges	from	two	to	three	times	the
length	of	their	bodies.	To	put	it	simply,	carnivores	have	distinctly	shorter	alimentary	canals
than	 herbivores,	 and	 this	 difference	 clearly	 indicates	 what	 type	 of	 food	 each	 species	 is
supposed	to	consume.

If	you	eat	raw	meat,	it	takes	between	seventy	to	seventy-two	hours	to	pass	through	your
system;	cooked	meat	takes	fifty	to	fifty-two	hours;	cooked	vegetables	twenty-four	to	thirty
hours;	uncooked	vegetables	twelve	to	fifteen	hours;	fruits	one	and	a	half	to	three	hours.

If	you	keep	raw	meat	outside	for	seventy	to	seventy-two	hours,	putrefaction	sets	in—one
small	piece	of	meat	can	evict	you	from	your	home!	Putrefaction	occurs	very	rapidly	in	the
summertime,	when	the	temperature	and	moisture	are	conducive.	Your	stomach	is	always	a
tropical	place,	and	if	meat	stays	there	for	up	to	seventy-two	hours,	the	level	of	putrefaction	is
very	high.	This	essentially	means	there	is	excessive	bacterial	activity,	and	your	body	must
expend	a	lot	of	energy	to	contain	the	bacterial	level,	so	that	it	does	not	cross	the	line	that
separates	health	from	illness.

If	you	visit	a	friend	who	is	sick	in	the	hospital,	you	would	surely	not	take	him	a	pizza	or	a
steak.	You	are	most	likely	to	take	him	fruit.	If	you	happen	to	be	in	the	wild,	what	would	be	the
first	thing	you	would	eat?	Definitely	fruit.	(You	remember	even	Adam	ate	an	apple,	although
we	know	what	trouble	that	got	him	into!)	Then	would	come	roots,	the	killing	of	an	animal,
cooking,	 and	 raising	 crops.	 Fruit	 is	 the	 most	 easily	 digestible	 food	 and	 all	 human	 beings
know	this	instinctively.

Most	carnivorous	animals	do	not	eat	every	day—definitely	not	three	times	a	day!	They
know	the	food	they	eat	moves	very	slowly	through	their	tracts.	A	tiger	is	said	to	eat	once
every	six	to	eight	days.	He	is	agile	and	prowls	when	he	is	hungry,	eats	a	hefty	meal	of	fifty-


five	pounds	of	meat	at	once,	and	then	generally	sleeps	or	ambles	around	lazily.	A	cobra	eats
sixty	percent	of	its	own	body	weight	in	a	single	meal,	and	eats	only	once	every	twelve	to
fifteen	days.	The	pygmies	from	the	central	African	region	used	to	hunt	elephants,	eat	their
organs	and	meat	raw,	and	drink	the	blood	fresh.	They	say	they	would	sleep	after	this	kind	of
meal	for	over	forty	hours	at	a	stretch.	But	as	lifestyles	change	and	grow	more	urban	and
sedentary,	it	is	clear	that	human	beings	cannot	maintain	such	a	mode	of	life.	You	certainly
cannot	afford	this	sort	of	lifestyle.	You	have	to	eat	every	day	and	rest	at	specific	times	because
your	alimentary	canal	is	similar	to	that	of	the	herbivores.


```
THE	PROTEIN	DEBATE
```
There	is	much	emphasis	laid	nowadays	on	eating	protein.	It	is	important	to
understand	that	only	three	percent	of	our	body	is	composed	of	protein	and
excess	protein	consumption	can	cause	cancer.	Meat	runs	high	in	protein.	A
very	small	portion	of	the	meat	that	one	consumes	can	fulfill	the	human	protein
requirement.	The	remaining	portion,	which	travels	very	slowly	through	the
alimentary	canal,	leads	to	a	variety	of	problems	such	as	excessive	bacterial
activity,	 enhanced	 sleep	 quota,	 increased	 inertia	 levels	 in	 the	 body,	 and
decreased	 cellular	 regeneration.	 All	 of	 this,	 in	 turn,	 manifests	 as	 a	 drop	 in
one’s	sensitivity	of	perception.	It	is	in	this	context	that	meat	has	been	regarded
as	spiritually	unsupportive,	because	the	spiritual	process	is	essentially	about
enhancing	one’s	perception	beyond	the	limitations	of	the	physical.


**Digestion	Drama**

Another	aspect	of	digestion	is	that	to	digest	a	certain	kind	of	food	the	human	system	produces
alkalis,	 and	 to	 digest	 another	 kind	 of	 food	 it	 generates	 acid.	 If	 you	 consume	 a	 jumble	 of
foods,	then	the	stomach	grows	confused	and	produces	both	acids	and	alkalis,	which	neutralize
each	 other	 and	 make	 the	 digestive	 juices	 lose	 their	 edge.	 Hence	 the	 food	 remains	 in	 the
stomach	longer	than	required,	and	weakens	our	ability	to	rejuvenate	on	the	cellular	level.

It	also	causes	what	we	refer	to	as	 _tamas,_ 	or	inertia,	in	the	energy	system,	which	over	a
period	of	time	will	alter	the	very	quality	of	who	you	are	and	impair	the	quality	of	who	you
could	be.	Traditionally,	in	southern	India,	people	took	care	never	to	mix	certain	foods.	But
today,	food	is	no	more	about	the	well-being	of	the	body,	but	a	social	affair.	People	eat	out	at
buffets	 and	 the	 variety	 and	 number	 of	 dishes	 served	 is	 considered	 more	 important	 than
nourishing	the	health	and	life	of	the	body.

The	question	is	not	about	what	not	to	eat,	but	about	how	much	of	what	to	eat.	It	is	not	a
moral	 issue;	 it	 is	 a	 question	 of	 life	 sense.	 As	 you	 battle	 city	 life,	 you	 need	 an	 agile	 and
working	 mind,	 and	 physical	 and	 mental	 balance.	 And	 some	 of	 you	 even	 have	 spiritual
aspirations—even	if	it	is	only	every	once	in	a	while!	So,	every	individual	must	arrive	at	his	or
her	own	balance	of	diet,	not	by	taking	vows,	but	by	observation	and	awareness.

It	is	important	not	to	turn	into	a	food	freak.	Food	should	never	become	an	all-consuming
affair.	Every	creature	on	the	planet	knows	what	to	eat	and	what	not	to.	What	is	the	human
problem	then?	The	human	problem	is	not	enough	attention,	but	too	much	information.

The	 yogic	 science	 works	 essentially	 with	 the	 interiority	 of	 the	 human	 being.	 Out	 of	 its
profound	understanding	of	the	science	of	the	human	mechanism,	this	science	later	branched
out	into	various	systems.	One	such	outcome	was	the	system	of	Ayurveda,	which	is	growing
increasingly	popular	once	again	in	modern	times.	The	word	 _ayur_ 	means	“life	span”	and	the
word	 _veda_ 	means	“science”	or	“knowledge.”	So,	Ayurveda	is	the	science	of	extending	the
human	life	span.	It	is	a	system	that	uses	external	plant	life	and	earth	elements	to	promote
health	and	to	correct	systemic	irregularities.	Knowledge	systems	like	these	were	intended	to
assist	those	who	are	incapable	of	doing	the	necessary	yogic	practice	to	achieve	the	same	ends.

Sadhana

```
The	consumption	of	a	spoonful	of	clarified	butter	(ghee	in	India)	on	a	daily	basis	a	few	minutes	before	a
```

meal	 does	 wonders	 for	 the	 digestive	 system.	 If	 you	 eat	 clarified	 butter	 with	 sugar,	 as	 in	 sweets,	 it	 is
digested	and	turns	into	fat.	But	clarified	butter	without	sugar	can	cleanse,	heal,	and	lubricate	the	alimentary
canal.	Additionally,	the	cleansing	of	the	colon	will	immediately	manifest	as	a	certain	glow	and	aliveness
in	your	skin.	Even	those	who	prefer	not	to	consume	dairy	products	could	experiment	with	this	because
clarified	butter	passes	through	the	system	largely	without	getting	digested.


```
EVOLUTIONARY	CODE
```
If	you	must	eat	non-vegetarian	food,	the	best	would	be	fish.	Firstly,	it	is	easily
digestible	 with	 very	 high	 nutritional	 values.	 Secondly,	 it	 leaves	 the	 least
amount	of	its	imprint	upon	you.

What	is	meant	by	this?
Our	bodies—all	that	we	eat,	excrete,	and	what	eventually	gets	cremated	or
buried—is	just	earth.	The	software	within	your	system	determines	that	if	you
eat	a	fruit	it	is	transformed	into	the	human	body,	and	not	into	a	monkey	or	a
mouse.	 The	 efficiency	 of	 your	 system	 obliterates	 the	 other	 software	 that
transformed	soil	into	a	fruit	and	arrives	at	a	new	software	that	will	make	a
fruit	into	a	human	form.	For	more	evolved	creatures,	particularly	mammals,
their	software	is	more	distinct	and	individuated.	This	makes	it	harder	for	your
code-breaking	system	to	erase	the	software	of	the	creature	that	you	consume
and	to	overwrite	it	with	a	new	software.

Among	the	animals,	fish,	being	one	of	the	earlier	forms	of	life	upon	this
planet,	have	the	easiest	software	code	for	our	system	to	break	and	integrate
into	ourselves.	Animals	that	have	more	intelligence,	particularly	those	that	are
capable	of	a	variety	of	emotions	(such	as	cows	or	dogs),	will	retain	their	own
memory	systems.	In	other	words,	we	are	incapable	of	completely	integrating
more	 evolved,	 intelligent,	 and	 emotionally	 endowed	 creatures	 into	 our
systems.

In	 earlier	 times,	 in	 communities	 that	 were	 more	 in	 tune	 with	 the	 earth,
people	 could	 hunt	 and	 eat	 animals	 and	 work	 out	 the	 consequences	 through
enormous	amounts	of	physical	activity.	But	given	the	largely	sedentary	lives
people	lead	nowadays,	the	acidity	produced	by	such	a	diet	could	contribute
greatly	to	the	unexplained	levels	of	stress	that	are	being	widely	experienced
today.	 Additionally,	 large	 animals,	 particularly	 cows,	 are	 aware	 of	 their
impending	 slaughter	 well	 before	 it	 happens.	 Consequently,	 they	 experience
high	stress	levels,	which	generate	a	tremendous	amount	of	acidic	content	in
their	systems.	 This,	in	 turn,	 has	its	 own	adverse	 impact	 on	those	 who	 later
consume	the	meat.


**Gastronomic	Sense**

If	you	observe	the	natural	cycle	of	the	body,	you	will	find	that	there	is	something	called	a
_mandala_ .	 A	 mandala	 is	 a	 cycle	 of	 forty	 to	 forty-eight	 days	 that	 the	 human	 system	 goes
through.	In	every	cycle,	there	will	be	three	days	on	which	your	body	does	not	need	food.

If	 you	 are	 conscious	 of	 how	 your	 body	 functions,	 you	 will	 become	 aware	 that	 on	 a
particular	day	the	body	does	not	require	food.	Without	effort,	you	can	go	without	food	on	that
day.	Even	dogs	and	cats	have	this	awareness;	on	a	particular	day	they	often	choose	not	to	eat.

The	day	the	system	says	“no	food”	is	a	cleanup	day.	Since	most	people	are	not	aware	of
which	day	their	body	should	go	without	food,	the	day	of	Ekadashi	was	fixed	in	the	Indian
calendar.	Ekadashi	is	the	eleventh	day	of	the	lunar	segment	and	recurs	every	fourteen	days.	It
is	traditionally	regarded	as	the	day	to	fast.	If	some	people	are	unable	to	go	without	food
because	their	activity	levels	demand	it,	or	if	they	do	not	have	the	appropriate	spiritual	practice
to	support	it,	they	can	opt	to	go	on	a	fruit	diet.

If	you	force	yourself	to	fast	without	preparing	your	body	and	mind	sufficiently,	you	will
only	cause	damage	to	your	health.	But	if	your	body,	mind,	and	energy	are	properly	prepared
with	the	necessary	practices,	then	fasting	can	be	of	much	benefit	to	you.

People	who	are	constantly	on	nicotine	and	caffeine	will	find	that	fasting	can	become	very
difficult.	So	before	fasting,	prepare	the	body	by	consuming	the	right	kind	of	nourishment,
particularly	high-water-content	foods	like	fruits	and	vegetables.	It	may	not	be	a	good	thing
for	everybody	to	fast,	but	it	has	many	benefits	if	it	is	done	with	proper	understanding.

The	entire	aim	and	endeavor	of	yoga	is	to	open	up	the	cocoon	of	the	physical	body	to	the
larger	sensory	body	where	you	experience	everything	as	a	part	of	you.	Fasting	is	an	extension
of	this	logic:	it	is	a	way	of	nourishing	yourself	without	any	active	ingestion.	It	may	be	done	as
a	 detoxification	 process	 nowadays,	 but	 this	 is	 the	 internal	 rationale.	 This	 is	 why	 every
spiritual	tradition	in	the	world	has	fixed	a	certain	period	of	fasting	for	its	adherents.	In	the
yogic	tradition,	the	fasting	period	was	fixed	according	to	the	lunar	cycle.	This	is	because	your
ability	to	assimilate	energy	from	water,	air,	and	sunlight	is	greater	on	certain	days	of	the	lunar
cycle.	In	some	religions,	the	fasting	period	was	fixed	in	peak	summer	when	the	consumption
of	water	and	sun	by	the	human	system	would	naturally	be	high.

My	great-grandmother,	a	wonderful	old	woman,	often	considered	eccentric	by	those	who
didn’t	know	any	better,	would	frequently	give	away	her	food	to	ants	and	sparrows.	Tears	of
bliss	would	be	streaming	down	her	face	as	she	did	this.	People	around	her	kept	saying,	“Why
don’t	 _you_ 	eat,	old	woman?”	She’d	simply	reply,	“I	am	full.”	But	all	those	advisers	died	a	long
time	before	she	did.	She	lived	on	and	died	at	the	incredible	age	of	a	hundred	and	thirteen!

```
My	mother	used	to	do	this	as	well:	every	day	before	she	ate	her	breakfast,	she	would	take
```

one	handful	of	it	and	go	looking	for	ants	to	feed.	Only	then	would	she	eat.	This	has	been	a
tradition	among	the	womenfolk	in	many	families.	An	ant	is	the	smallest	living	entity	you	can
see	around	you,	the	most	inconsequential	organism	you	can	think	of.	So,	for	that	very	reason,
you	feed	it	first.	You	make	an	offering	not	to	the	gods,	or	other	celestial	creatures,	but	to	the
smallest	creature	you	know.	This	planet	belongs	as	much	to	them	as	it	belongs	to	you.	You
understand	 that	 every	 creature	 on	 this	 planet	 has	 the	 same	 right	 to	 live	 as	 you	 have.	 This
awareness	 can	 help	 create	 a	 conducive	 atmosphere,	 mentally	 and	 physically,	 for
consciousness	to	grow.

Just	a	simple	act	like	this	loosens	you	from	your	identification	with	the	physical	body.	As
you	become	less	of	a	body,	your	awareness	of	the	other	dimensions	of	who	you	are	naturally
becomes	enhanced.	When	you	are	very	hungry	all	your	body	wants	to	do	is	eat.	Just	wait	for
two	minutes;	you	will	find	that	it	will	make	a	big	difference.	When	you	are	very	hungry,	you
_are_ 	the	body.	Give	it	a	little	space	and	suddenly	you	are	not	just	a	body.

Gautama	the	Buddha	went	to	the	extent	of	saying,	“When	you	are	badly	in	need	of	food,	if
you	give	away	your	food	to	somebody	else,	you	will	become	stronger.”	I	am	not	going	that
far	with	you;	I	am	only	saying,	just	wait	a	few	minutes!	It	will	definitely	leave	you	stronger.

If	you	are	very	compulsive	about	food,	it	is	good	to	miss	one	meal	consciously.	Try	doing
this:	on	a	day	when	you	are	particularly	hungry	and	some	of	your	favorite	dishes	are	being
cooked,	try	skipping	a	meal.	This	is	not	to	torture	yourself;	this	is	just	to	become	free	from
the	torture	chamber	that	your	body	can	very	easily	become.

What	kind	of	food	you	eat,	how	much	you	eat,	how	you	eat,	turning	it	from	a	compulsive
pattern	into	a	conscious	process:	this	is	the	essence	of	fasting.

Sadhana

```
Just	 experiment.	 Start	 with	 twenty-five	 percent	 natural,	 uncooked,	 or	 live	 food—fruit	 or	 vegetables—
today,	and	slowly	push	it	up	to	a	hundred	percent	in	about	four	or	five	days.	Stay	there	for	a	day	or	two,
and	again	cut	it	down	by	ten	percent	and	in	another	five	days	you	will	reach	fifty	percent	raw	food,	fifty
percent	cooked	food.	This	is	ideal	for	most	people,	who	wish	to	be	active	for	sixteen	to	eighteen	hours	a
day.
Remember,	if	you	eat	cooked	food,	it	may	take	you	fifteen	minutes	to	eat	a	meal.	If	you	eat	raw	food,
you	take	a	little	more	time	to	eat	the	same	quantum	of	food,	because	you	have	to	chew	a	little	more.	But
the	nature	of	the	body	is	such	that	after	fifteen	minutes	the	body	will	tell	you	that	your	meal	is	over.	So
people	tend	to	eat	much	less	and	lose	weight.	All	it	takes	is	being	a	little	more	conscious	of	how	much
you	are	eating.
```

**Restlessness	to	Restfulness**

The	fact	that	you	sleep	at	night	makes	some	difference	between	your	mornings	and	evenings.
What	is	making	the	difference	is	the	level	of	relaxation	that	sleep	brings.	If	you	could	remain
relaxed	 while	 performing	 all	 the	 activity	 of	 the	 day,	 you	 would	 be	 about	 the	 same	 in	 the
evening,	in	terms	of	energy	and	enthusiasm,	as	you	were	in	the	morning.

If	 you	 wake	 up	 fresh,	 that	 is	 a	 good	 beginning,	 but	 slowly	 through	 the	 day,	 as	 your
relaxation	levels	come	down,	you	gradually	start	feeling	stressed.	Stress	is	 _not_ 	because	of
work—this	 is	 important	 to	 remember.	 Everybody	 thinks	 their	 job	 is	 stressful.	 No	 job	 is
stressful.	There	are	many	jobs	that	could	present	challenging	situations.	There	could	be	nasty
bosses,	 insecure	 colleagues,	 emergency	 rooms,	 impossible	 deadlines—or	 you	 might	 even
find	yourself	in	the	middle	of	a	war	zone!	But	these	are	not	 _inherently_ 	stressful.	It	is	our
compulsive	reaction	to	the	situations	in	which	we	are	placed	that	causes	stress.	Stress	is	a
certain	level	of	internal	friction.	One	can	easily	lubricate	the	inner	mechanism	with	some
amount	of	inner	work	and	awareness.	So,	it	is	your	inability	to	handle	your	own	system	that	is
stressing	 you	 out.	 On	 some	 level,	 you	 do	 not	 know	 how	 to	 handle	 your	 body,	 mind,	 and
emotions;	that	is	the	problem.

How	then	do	you	keep	your	system	free	of	stress	so	that	you	remain	in	the	same	level	of
enthusiasm,	relaxation,	and	happiness,	whether	it	is	morning	or	evening?

An	average	person’s	pulse	rate	on	an	empty	stomach	would	be	in	the	seventies	or	even
eighties.	For	a	person	doing	the	right	type	of	meditative	practice,	you	will	find	that	the	pulse
rate	would	range	between	the	thirties	and	forties.	Even	after	a	good	lunch	it	would	stay	in	the
fifties.	 This	 is	 just	 one	 parameter	 that	 indicates	 the	 level	 of	 restfulness	 that	 your	 body	 is
experiencing	 moment	 to	 moment.	 Restfulness	 essentially	 defines	 the	 replenishing	 and
rejuvenating	capability	of	the	body.

You	cannot	slow	down	your	system	at	the	cost	of	activity.	What	is	necessary	is	to	keep	your
system	in	such	a	way	that	activity	does	not	take	its	toll	upon	it.	Maybe	physically	you	get
exhausted,	but	it	need	not	stress	you	in	any	way.	If	you	are	capable	of	being	vibrantly	active
and	still	relaxed,	then	it	is	worthwhile.	If	you	start	certain	simple	practices	of	yoga,	in	three	to
four	months’	time,	your	pulse	rate	will	drop	at	least	eight	to	twenty	counts	very	easily.	That
means	the	body	is	running	so	much	more	efficiently	and	at	a	relaxed	pace.

What	the	body	needs	is	not	sleep	but	restfulness.	If	you	keep	the	body	very	relaxed	through
the	day,	your	sleep	quota	will	go	down	naturally.	If	your	work	and	taking	a	walk	or	exercising
are	also	relaxation	for	you,	your	sleep	quota	will	drop	even	further.

Right	now,	people	want	to	do	everything	the	hard	way.	I	see	people	walking	in	the	park	in	a
state	of	tension.	Whether	you	walk	or	jog,	why	can’t	it	be	done	easily,	joyfully?	This	exercise
may	be	causing	more	harm	to	you	than	well-being	because	you	are	going	at	it	as	if	you’re


going	into	battle!

Don’t	battle	with	life.	You	are	not	anti-life;	you	 _are_ 	life.	Just	get	in	tune	with	it	and	you	will
see	that	you	will	pass	through	it	easily.	Keeping	yourself	fit	and	well	is	not	a	battle.	Do	some
activity	that	you	enjoy:	play	a	game,	swim,	walk,	run.	If	you	don’t	like	to	do	anything	except
eat	 cheesecake	 all	 day,	 then	 you	 have	 a	 problem!	 Otherwise,	 there	 is	 no	 incompatibility
between	being	active	and	relaxed	at	the	same	time.

How	much	sleep	does	your	body	need?	It	depends	on	the	level	of	physical	activity	you	are
engaged	in.	There	is	no	need	to	fix	the	quota	of	either	food	or	sleep.	To	program	the	calories
you	must	consume	and	the	number	of	hours	you	must	sleep	is	a	foolish	way	to	handle	life.	Let
the	body	decide	how	much	it	should	eat	today,	not	you.	Today	your	activity	levels	are	low,	so
you	eat	less.	Tomorrow	your	activity	is	high,	so	you	eat	more.	Similarly	with	sleep:	when	you
feel	sufficiently	relaxed	you	come	awake.	The	moment	the	body	is	rested	it	will	wake	up—
whether	it	be	at	three	or	four	or	eight	o’clock.	When	it	comes	to	food	and	sleep,	your	body	is
the	best	judge.

If	the	body	is	at	a	certain	level	of	alertness	and	awareness	you	will	see	that	once	it	is	well
rested,	it	will	awaken—that	is,	if	it	is	eager	to	come	to	life.	If	it	is	somehow	trying	to	use	the
bed	as	a	grave,	then	it	is	a	problem.	Keep	the	body	in	such	a	way	that	it	is	not	longing	to	avoid
or	escape	life.	Maintain	it	in	such	a	way	that	it	is	longing	to	come	awake.

Sadhana

```
If	you	sleep	without	a	pillow	or	with	a	very	low	pillow,	which	doesn’t	allow	the	spine	to	get	pinched,	the
neuronal	regeneration	of	the	brain	and	the	cellular	regeneration	of	the	neurological	system	will	be	much
better.	If	you	sleep	without	a	pillow,	it	is	best	to	lie	on	your	back	in	a	supine	position,	rather	than	on	your
side.	Lying	in	this	position	is	referred	to	in	yoga	as	 shavasana: 	it	enhances	the	purification	and	rejuvenation
of	the	body,	promotes	the	free	flow	of	movement	in	the	energy	system,	bringing	relaxation	and	vitality.
But	there	is	no	reason	to	get	dogmatic	about	this.	(At	least	in	your	sleep,	don’t	take	a	position!)
```

**Carnal	to	Cosmic**

Existence	 is	 a	 dance	 between	 the	 unmanifest	 and	 the	 manifest.	 The	 moment	 there	 is	 a
manifestation,	there	is	duality:	light	and	darkness,	male	and	female,	birth	and	death,	and	so	on.
Though	unity	is	the	basic	fabric	of	creation,	duality	brings	texture,	design,	and	color	to	life.
All	the	various	manifestations	that	you	see	as	life	today	are	fundamentally	rooted	in	duality.
Because	there	are	two,	there	are	many.	If	there	were	only	one,	there	would	be	no	existence.
Once	there	are	two,	the	game	of	life	begins.

Once	duality	begins,	sex	begins.	What	we	call	sex	is	just	two	parts	of	this	duality	striving	to
become	one.	In	the	process	of	these	dualities	meeting,	there	are	also	certain	functions	that
Nature	wants	to	fulfill,	like	procreation	and	the	survival	of	the	species.	All	duality	is	striving
for	unity	because	what	was	once	one	has	manifested	itself	as	two;	now	there	is	a	perpetual
longing	to	become	one.

This	longing	to	become	one	finds	expression	in	many	ways.	When	you	are	young	and	your
intelligence	is	hijacked	by	your	hormones,	sex	will	be	the	way.	When	you	are	middle-aged
and	your	intelligence	is	hijacked	by	your	emotions,	love	is	the	way.	When	you	are	old	and
bereft	of	hormonal	mischief,	prayer	is	the	way.	But	irrespective	of	age,	when	you	transcend
all	this	and	seek	the	same	union	on	a	much	higher	level	of	awareness,	then	yoga	is	the	way.

If	you	are	seeking	oneness	with	the	body,	you	need	to	remember	that	physical	bodies	will
always	remain	two,	no	matter	what	you	do.	For	a	few	moments,	a	sense	of	unity	will	happen,
and	then	people	fall	apart.	If	divorce	does	not	do	it,	death	will.	It	is	bound	to	happen.

Sex	is	just	two	opposites	making	an	attempt	to	become	one.	Your	individuality	means	not
only	false	boundaries	that	you	have	set	up	in	your	mental	framework	in	the	form	of	your
preferences	 and	 dislikes,	 tastes	 and	 opinions.	 It	 also	 means	 you	 are	 trapped	 within	 the
boundaries	of	your	own	physical	body.	You	may	not	be	consciously	aware,	but	the	life	within
you	is	longing	to	break	these	boundaries.	When	you	want	to	break	your	mental	boundaries
you	may	long	to	have	a	serious	conversation	or	read	a	book,	drink	alcohol,	take	a	drug,	or	do
something	freaky.	To	break	your	physical	boundaries	you	may	want	to	pierce	yourself,	get	a
tattoo,	dye	your	hair,	or	go	the	old-fashioned	way	of	sex.

The	intention	of	sex	is	great,	but	the	method	is	hopeless.	Pleasure	is	involved,	so	it	drives
two	people	toward	each	other,	but	oneness	comes	only	momentarily.	So	you	try	to	meet	in
other	areas	of	emotion	and	intellect.	People	are	always	trying	to	find	common	ground:	“We
like	the	same	ice	cream,	both	of	us	are	blond,	both	of	us	play	videogames,	share	the	same
zodiac	sign,	and	like	the	same	TV	shows...”	But	unless	you	understand	that	you	can	never
become	one,	you	will	not	learn	to	enjoy	the	opposite.

These	 two	 energies,	 which	 in	 the	 human	 race	 we	 call	 “masculine”	 and	 “feminine,”	 are
always	trying	to	come	together.	At	the	same	time,	except	for	this	longing	to	be	together,	they


are	opposites.	They	are	lovers	and	enemies	at	the	same	time.	If	they	look	for	similarities,
there	seems	to	be	little	common	ground,	but	the	attraction	of	the	opposite	is	always	there.

A	lot	of	people	cannot	face	the	basic	physical	act	as	it	is,	so	they	have	invented	all	kinds	of
decorations	around	it	to	make	it	beautiful.	You	always	add	emotion	to	it,	because	without
emotion	it	would	seem	ugly.	In	some	way	you	are	trying	to	cloud	your	vision	of	reality	with
lots	of	decorations.

Sex	 is	 natural;	 it	 is	 there	 in	 the	 body.	 Sexuality	 is	 something	 you	 invented;	 it	 is
psychological.	If	sex	is	in	the	body,	it	is	fine,	it	is	beautiful.	The	moment	it	enters	your	mind,
it	becomes	a	perversion.	It	has	no	business	with	your	mind.	Sex	is	a	small	aspect	of	you,	but
today	it	has	become	huge.	For	many,	it	has	become	life	itself.

If	you	look	at	modern	societies,	I	would	say	probably	ninety	percent	of	human	energy	is
being	spent	either	pursuing	or	avoiding	sex.	Sex	is	just	nature’s	trick	to	reproduce.	If	this
attraction	of	opposites	did	not	exist,	the	species	would	become	extinct.	But	now	we	have	made
such	a	distinction	between	man	and	woman,	almost	as	if	they	are	two	separate	species.	No
other	creature	on	the	planet	has	the	kind	of	problems	with	sex	that	humans	have.	With	animals,
the	urge	is	present	in	their	body	at	certain	times;	otherwise	they	are	free	from	it.	With	humans
it	is	on	their	minds	all	the	time.

One	 reason	 this	 has	 happened	 is	 that	 in	 the	 past,	 many	 religions	 went	 about	 denying	 a
simple	physical	process	to	the	extent	of	making	it	sinful.	Because	we	could	not	even	accept	the
biology	 of	 a	 human	 being,	 instead	 of	 looking	 beyond	 the	 limitations	 of	 the	 biological
process,	 we	 tried	 to	 deny	 it.	 If	 we	 had	 no	 problem	 with	 biology,	 we	 would	 not	 make	 a
distinction	 between	 who	 was	 who.	 Everybody	 would	 be	 known	 for	 what	 they	 are	 worth;
whether	somebody	is	male	or	female	would	be	irrelevant.	The	whole	exploitation	of	women
starts	once	you	cannot	accept	the	fundamental	differences	between	a	man	and	a	woman.

You	 do	 not	 have	 to	 make	 biology	 sacred,	 nor	 do	 you	 have	 to	 make	 it	 filthy.	 It	 is	 the
instrument	of	life.	Because	of	it	you	exist.	If	you	know	how	to	live	it	without	elevating	it	or
making	it	ugly,	it	has	a	beauty	of	its	own.

The	sensuousness	that	you	experience	in	life	is	a	chemical	invitation	for	something	that	is
not	you	to	become	a	part	of	you.	This	is	Nature’s	way	of	instigating	you	toward	a	union,	or
yoga.	Though	sensuousness	is	celebratory	in	its	nature,	it	is	discriminatory	too.	When	two
individuals	are	in	a	passionate	meeting,	the	rest	of	the	world	is	excluded,	or	even	obliterated.
If	the	celebration	has	to	last,	your	sensuousness	or	your	passion	has	to	become	all-inclusive.
If	you	are	in	a	state	of	all-inclusive	passion,	we	call	this	yoga.	So,	 _denial	 is	 not	 the	 answer.
Expansion	is	the	only	answer._

And	 if	 you	 have	 not	 known	 the	 sensuousness	 of	 the	 life-giving	 breath	 that	 is	 on	 every
moment	of	your	life,	how	can	you	even	begin	to	know	any	other	kind?	Experiencing	the
orgasmic	nature	of	the	breathing	process	is	called	 _ana	pana	sati	yoga,_ 	the	yoga	of	incoming
and	outgoing	breath.	 _Ana	pana_ 	literally	means	“in”	and	“out.”	 _Sati_ 	means	“female	consort.”
So,	the	reference	here	is	clearly	to	orgasmic	union.	And	so,	ana	pana	sati	yoga	is	a	process
that	initiates	you	into	a	conscious	and	profound	involvement	with	your	breath,	and	shows	you
how	the	simple	incoming	and	outgoing	breath	can	become	a	source	of	nameless	ecstasies.


Sadhana

The	 higher	 possibilities	 of	 life	 are	 housed	 in	 the	 human	 body.	 The	 physical	 body	 is	 a	 platform	 for	 all
possibilities	from	the	gross	to	the	sacred.	You	can	perform	simple	acts	of	eating,	sleeping,	and	sex	as	acts
of	grossness,	or	you	can	bring	a	certain	dimension	of	sanctity	to	all	these	aspects.	This	sanctity	can	be
achieved	by	bringing	subtler	thought,	emotion,	and	intention	into	these	acts.	Above	all,	remember	that	the
grossness	and	sanctity	of	something	is	largely	decided	by	your	unwillingness	and	unconsciousness,	or
your	willingness	and	consciousness.	Every	breath,	every	step,	every	simple	act,	thought,	and	emotion	can
acquire	the	stance	of	the	sacred	if	conducted	recognizing	the	sanctity	of	the	other	involved—whether	a
person	or	a	foodstuff	or	an	object	that	you	use.
Of	all	the	loving	acts	that	two	human	beings	are	capable	of,	the	simple	act	of	holding	hands	can	often
become	the	most	intimate.	Why	is	this	so?	Basically,	because	the	nature	of	the	hands	and	feet	is	such	that
the	energy	system	finds	expression	in	these	two	parts	of	the	body	in	a	very	singular	way.	Two	palms
coming	together	have	far	more	intimacy	than	the	contact	between	any	other	parts	of	the	body.
You	can	try	this	with	yourself.	You	don’t	even	need	a	partner.	When	you	put	your	hands	together,	the
two	energy	dimensions	within	you	(right-left,	masculine-feminine,	solar-lunar,	yin-yang,	etc.)	are	linked	in
a	 certain	 way,	 and	 you	 begin	 to	 experience	 a	 sense	 of	 unity	 within	 yourself.	 This	 is	 the	 logic	 of	 the
traditional	Indian	 _namaskar._ 	It	is	a	means	of	harmonizing	the	system.
So,	the	simplest	way	to	experience	a	state	of	union	is	to	try	this	simple	namaskar	yoga.	Put	your	hands
together,	 and	 pay	 loving	 attention	 to	 any	 object	 you	 use	 or	 consume,	 or	 any	 form	 of	 life	 that	 you
encounter.	 When	 you	 bring	 this	 sense	 of	 awareness	 into	 every	 simple	 act,	 your	 experience	 of	 life	 will
never	be	the	same	again.	There	is	even	a	possibility	that	if	you	put	your	hands	together,	you	could	unite	the
world!


**Hormonal	Hijack**

I	was	once	asked,	“Isn’t	it	strange	that	people	are	more	obsessed	with	sex	than	any	other
physical	urge?”	Nothing	strange	about	it.	It	is	just	the	hormonal	hijack	we	talked	about	earlier.
In	any	case,	sex	is	not	the	most	powerful	urge.	Hunger	is.

Most	of	the	time,	thinking	about	sex	is	just	compulsive	behavior.	When	you	were	a	child,	it
did	 not	 matter	 what	 reproductive	 organs	 someone	 had.	 The	 moment	 the	 hormones	 started
playing	within	you,	you	could	not	think	of	the	world	beyond	that.	And	you	will	see	that	after	a
certain	age,	when	the	play	of	hormones	subsides,	once	again	it	will	not	matter.	You	will	look
back	and	not	believe	you	were	the	one	obsessing	about	it.

There	is	nothing	wrong	with	the	body;	it	is	just	limited.	Nothing	wrong	with	being	limited
either.	If	you	go	by	the	way	of	the	body,	some	pleasure	may	come	to	you.	It	is	not	a	crime	to
want	to	be	limited,	but	you	will	live	an	unfulfilled	life.

Let	us	say	tomorrow	I	grant	you	a	boon	and	all	the	women	or	men	in	the	world	are	lusting
after	you.	You	will	find	that	you	are	still	not	satisfied.	A	little	bit	of	pleasure	and	pain	will
happen,	but	you	will	only	live	within	the	sphere	of	the	body.	The	body	knows	only	survival
and	procreation.	And	it	is	walking	straight	to	the	grave	every	moment,	nowhere	else.

Your	 body	 is	 just	 a	 loan	 from	 this	 planet.	 What	 you	 call	 “death”	 is	 just	 Mother	 Earth
reclaiming	the	loan	that	she	offered	to	you.	All	life	on	this	planet	is	just	a	recycle	of	the	Earth.
You	may	think	right	now	that	you	are	going	to	your	office,	home,	or	football	match,	but	as
far	as	your	body	is	concerned,	it	is	going,	moment	by	moment,	straight	toward	the	grave.
Right	now,	you	may	have	forgotten,	but	slowly,	as	time	passes,	it	will	become	more	apparent
that	this	is	the	nature	of	the	body.	If	all	that	you	have	known	is	the	body—and	anyway	you	are
going	to	lose	it—anxiety	and	fear	will	be	your	constant	companions.

People	are	even	beginning	to	think	that	fear	is	a	natural	part	of	their	existence.	No.	Fear	is	a
result	of	the	incompleteness	of	your	existence.	If	you	have	not	explored	life	in	its	magnitude
and	 multidimensionality,	 but	 have	 limited	 yourself	 to	 the	 physical	 body,	 fear	 is	 a	 natural
consequence.

Ever	heard	of	George	Best?	He	was	one	of	the	greatest	footballers	of	his	time	in	England.
He	was	determined	to	make	the	most	of	his	life	in	the	way	he	knew	best.	The	media	described
him	as	having	every	popular	film	star	and	fashion	model	on	his	arm	at	some	time	or	the
other.	But	by	the	time	he	reached	the	age	of	thirty-five,	he	was	a	broken,	miserable,	frustrated
man;	by	the	age	of	fifty-nine,	he	was	dead.	Death	is	not	the	issue,	but	the	way	you	live	 _is_ 	the
issue.	George	Best	supposedly	had	it	all	but	he	lived	a	terrible	life.

This	is	because	the	way	of	the	physical	is	circumscribed.	The	body	has	only	so	much	of	a
role	to	play	in	your	life.	If	you	try	to	stretch	it	to	all	of	your	life,	you	will	suffer	because	you
are	trying	to	create	a	falsehood.	Life	has	a	million	ingenious	ways	to	bend	you,	break	you,


knead	you,	and	grind	you.

Nothing	wrong	with	your	hormones,	but	once	you	live	a	compulsive	life,	you	are	living	the
life	 of	 a	 slave.	 Everything	 may	 be	 going	 on	 fine	 with	 your	 life—your	 business,	 family,
relationships—but	slowly,	as	different	kinds	of	compulsions	take	over,	you	grow	more	and
more	miserable.	There	is	something	within	you	that	is	unwilling	to	be	a	slave.	For	many,	the
pursuit	of	wealth	and	physical	well-being	drives	them	to	increasingly	desperate	actions.	If	you
look	under	the	veneer	of	civilization	you	will	uncover	the	most	abominable	forms	of	abuse.
We	are	not	even	sparing	our	own	children.	These	are	the	consequences	of	not	attending	to	all
the	dimensions	of	being	human,	and	limiting	ourselves	to	the	narrow	realm	of	the	physical.

Today,	in	attempting	to	fetishize	the	body,	people	are	creating	untold	suffering.	You	cannot
think	of	a	better	arrangement	materially:	in	terms	of	healthcare,	insurance,	cars.	You	have
more	 comforts	 and	 conveniences	 than	 any	 previous	 generation.	 But	 people	 are	 suffering
immensely.	In	affluent	societies	almost	every	fifth	person	is	on	some	kind	of	medication	just
to	maintain	mental	balance.	When	you	have	to	take	a	tablet	every	day	to	remain	sane,	this	is
not	joyfulness.	You	are	on	the	verge	of	breaking	down	because	you	have	made	a	small	aspect
of	your	life	the	whole	of	your	life.


```
MORTALITY	AND	PROFUNDITY
```
Only	when	you	recognize	your	mortal	nature	do	you	want	to	know	what	more
there	is	to	life.	It	is	then	that	the	spiritual	process	opens	up.

Once	it	happened...Two	men	over	eighty	years	of	age	met.	One	recognized
the	other	and	said,	“Did	you	fight	in	World	War	II?”

The	other	man	said,	“Yes.”
The	first	asked	him	where,	and	with	which	battalion.	The	other	man	told
him.

The	first	exclaimed,	“Oh,	my	God!	Don’t	you	recognize	me?	We	were	in
the	same	foxhole!”

Oh,	they	hit	it	off!	They	talked	and	talked.	All	that	they	had	actually	seen	was
about	forty	minutes	of	an	intense	combat	situation.	But	they	talked	about	every
bullet	that	went	by,	 _zing_ ,	 _zing_ ,	just	missing	them	by	inches.	They	spoke	for
over	four	hours	about	those	forty	minutes.

When	they	had	exhausted	everything	that	they	could	say	about	that	time,	one
asked	the	other,	“What	have	you	been	doing	since	the	war?”

“Oh,	for	the	past	sixty	years,	I’ve	just	been	a	salesman.”
Those	forty	minutes	had	come	to	define	their	lives	because	their	mortality
was	dangling	in	front	of	them	at	every	moment.	In	battle	they	had	forged	a
bond	that	was	profound.	Beyond	that,	this	man’s	life	could	be	summed	up	in	a
single	sentence:	he	was	just	a	salesman.

You	discover	an	indescribable	profundity	within	yourself	when	you	realize
your	mortal	nature.	If	you	have	not	realized	your	eternal	nature	you	must	at
least	realize	your	mortal	nature.	Death	is	not	the	end	of	life.	Death	is	simply
the	end	of	the	body.	If	you	have	lived	with	a	very	deep	identification	with	the
physical,	the	more	you	will	struggle	with	death,	because	death	marks	the	end
of	 the	 body.	 Only	 when	 you	 confront	 your	 mortality—the	 potential	 but
inevitable	termination	of	your	physical	form—does	the	longing	to	go	beyond
become	genuine.



**Miracle	or	Mess?**

Once	it	happened...A	man	wished	to	acquire	supernatural	powers.	He	went	from	one	guru	to
another,	 desperately	 in	 search	 of	 instruction.	 He	 eventually	 found	 his	 way	 to	 a	 remote
hermitage	in	the	Himalayan	wilderness.

The	guru	of	the	ashram	divined	the	purpose	of	his	quest	and	tried	to	dissuade	him.	“What
will	you	do	with	these	powers?	So	what	if	you	learn	to	walk	upon	the	water?	After	three	days,
a	boat	will	be	better!	Don’t	waste	your	life	on	these	irrelevant	pursuits.	Let	me	teach	you
meditation	 instead.”	 The	 master	 made	 many	 attempts	 to	 dissuade	 him,	 but	 the	 man	 was
adamant.

The	guru	finally	said,	“Well,	if	you’re	so	determined,	take	a	dip	in	the	river	tomorrow
morning	 at	 four	 o’clock	 and	 come	 to	 me.	 I	 will	 initiate	 you	 into	 the	 secrets	 of	 the
supernatural.”

The	man	was	excited.	He	took	a	pre-dawn	dip	in	a	freezing	Himalayan	river,	turned	half
blue,	and	came	and	sat	expectantly	before	the	master.

The	guru	said,	“See,	this	is	very	simple.	I	have	a	secret	mantra.	If	you	utter	it	three	times
over	for	the	next	forty	days,	all	the	supernatural	powers	will	be	yours.”

He	then	revealed	the	mantra:
_Asatoma	sadgamaya._
From	ignorance,	lead	me	to	truth.
The	guru	said,	“You	have	to	repeat	this	sacred	mantra	three	times	a	day	for	the	next	forty
days	and	the	entire	realm	of	the	supernatural	will	be	yours.	But	when	uttering	the	mantra,	just
don’t	think	of	monkeys.”

The	man	was	incredulous	at	the	simplicity	of	the	practice.	“Is	that	all?”	he	asked	joyfully.
“May	I	leave	now?”

The	guru	said,	“By	all	means.	Please	go	and	return	in	forty	days.”
The	man	left	in	a	state	of	great	excitement.	“The	fool	of	a	guru	revealed	all	his	secrets	to
me	without	even	charging	a	fee!”	he	thought.	“And	he	is	telling	me	not	to	think	of	monkeys.
Why	would	I	think	of	monkeys?	Ridiculous!”

He	came	down	the	mountainside	and	reached	the	banks	of	the	river	Ganga.	He	took	a	dip	in
the	holy	river	and	sat	down	to	begin	his	practice.	But	no	sooner	had	he	uttered	the	word
“asatoma”—and	monkeys!	Each	time	a	monkey	popped	into	his	head,	he	took	another	dip	in
the	river.	He	attempted	the	mantra	in	various	yogic	postures.	But	each	time	he	uttered	the	very
first	syllable,	monkeys	would	appear.	In	hordes.	In	one	week	of	intense	practice,	there	was	no
need	of	a	mantra	anymore.	It	was	a	universe	full	of	monkeys—a	simian	nightmare.	Harassed
by	these	countless	monkeys,	unable	to	do	a	thing,	the	man	went	all	the	way	back	to	the	guru


and	said,	“I	don’t	want	your	damn	supernatural	powers.	Relieve	me	of	these	monkeys	first!”

If	you	tell	yourself	you	don’t	want	to	think	a	certain	thought,	that	is	precisely	the	first	thing
your	mind	will	produce!	That	is	the	nature	of	the	human	mind.

In	recent	times,	much	scientific	research	has	been	conducted	on	the	activity	of	the	brain.	If
you	 look	 at	 the	 way	 neurons	 fire	 in	 the	 brain,	 there	 is	 a	 tremendous	 cohesiveness	 in	 this
activity.	 It	 is	 this	 cohesiveness	 that	 translates	 into	 the	 efficient	 functioning	 of	 the	 body.	 A
billion	sophisticated	activities	are	being	performed	in	your	body	right	now	because	of	the
highly	coordinated	and	complex	dance	of	neurons.

But	the	mind,	in	most	people’s	experience,	has	unfortunately	become	a	circus.	A	circus	is
actually	a	very	coordinated	activity,	deliberately	made	to	look	like	a	mess.	Even	the	clown	in
the	circus	is	a	gymnast.	He	may	play	the	buffoon,	but	he	is	hugely	talented	and	skillful	in	what
he	does.	The	metaphor	of	the	clown	sums	up	the	experience	of	most	people	when	it	comes	to
their	mental	activity.

How	did	the	mind,	that	amazing	gymnast,	become	a	clown?	How	did	it	turn	from	a	source
of	 magic	 to	 such	 a	 mess?	 Why	 has	 this	 miraculous	 instrument	 become	 such	 a	 misery-
manufacturing	machine?

As	noted	earlier,	every	human	being	is	essentially	seeking	pleasantness,	within	and	without.
When	 it	 comes	 to	 the	 outside,	 there	 are	 a	 million	 ingredients,	 and	 nobody	 has	 complete
mastery	 over	 them.	 When	 it	 comes	 to	 the	 inner	 situation,	 however,	 there	 is	 only	 one
ingredient:	 _you_ .	You	can	be	the	sole	architect	and	creator	of	your	inner	life.	But	you	don’t
know	how.	That	is	the	rub.	If	you	were	in	charge,	for	sure	you	would	not	manufacture	misery
for	yourself.	A	fundamental	freedom	you	have	is	to	 _think_ 	whatever	you	want.	What	then	stops
you	from	thinking	pleasant	thoughts?

The	 problem	 is	 just	 this:	 the	 fact	 that	 your	 mind	 is	 not	 taking	 instructions	 from	 you.
Imagine	a	Paleolithic	caveman	punching	a	computer	keyboard.	What’s	going	to	come	up	on
screen	will	look	like	a	series	of	obscenities!

The	system	of	yoga	is	a	technology	to	create	 _a	 distinction	 between	 you	 and	 your	 mind._
There	 is	 a	 space	 between	 you	 and	 what	 you	 have	 gathered	 in	 terms	 of	 body	 and	 mind.
Becoming	conscious	of	this	space	is	your	first	and	only	step	to	freedom.	It	is	the	accumulated
physiological	and	psychological	content	that	causes	the	cyclical	patterns	in	your	life	and	even
beyond.	If	you	can	be	constantly	conscious	of	this	space	between	you	and	the	body-mind,	you
have	opened	up	a	dimension	of	limitless	possibility.

There	 are	 only	 two	 forms	 of	 suffering	 in	 this	 world:	 physical	 and	 mental.	 Once	 this
distance	becomes	a	constant	factor	in	your	experience,	you	have	reached	the	end	of	suffering.
With	the	elimination	of	the	fear	of	suffering,	you	can	walk	life	full	stride,	unafraid	to	explore
all	 that	 life	 has	 to	 offer.	 Your	 ability	 to	 use	 this	 immensely	 sophisticated	 body-mind
phenomenon	can	be	raised	to	a	completely	new	dimension	of	experience	and	utility	as	you
stand	 outside	 of	 them.	 This	 sounds	 paradoxical,	 but	 it	 is	 true.	 As	 the	 experience	 of	 space
grows,	the	mind	is	no	more	a	mess.	It	is	a	great	symphony,	a	tremendous	possibility	that	can
take	you	to	great	heights.

```
Yoga	is	a	journey	toward	a	reality	in	which	you	experience	the	ultimate	nature	of	existence
```

as	 _borderless	unity_ .	This	experience	is	possible	only	if	you	maintain	that	space	between	you
and	your	body-mind.	It	is	important	to	remember	that	this	borderless	unity	is	an	experience,
not	 an	 idea,	 philosophy,	 or	 concept.	 If	 you	 vouch	 for	 the	 oneness	 of	 the	 universe	 as	 an
intellectual	theory,	this	may	make	you	popular	at	a	dinner	party	or	win	you	applause	at	a
seminar.	 You	 may	 even	 get	 a	 Nobel	 Prize.	 But	 it	 does	 not	 serve	 any	 other	 purpose.	 The
_experience_ of	 borderless	 unity,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 can	 deliver	 you	 to	 another	 dimension
altogether—a	dimension	of	love	and	blissfulness,	a	dimension	far	beyond	the	cerebral.

It	can	actually	be	damaging	to	an	individual	to	see	everything	as	one,	intellectually.	People
often	profess	all	kinds	of	fancy	philosophical	theories	about	becoming	one	with	the	cosmos,
about	loving	the	entire	world,	until	life	teaches	them	a	good	lesson.	When	it	comes	to	money,
the	boundary	between	self	and	other	is	abundantly	clear.	At	such	times,	there	is	no	question	of
you	and	me	being	one!

Once	it	happened...Shankaran	Pillai	went	to	a	Vedanta	class.	Vedanta	is	the	school	of	Indian
metaphysics	that	speaks	of	the	non-duality	of	the	self	and	the	divine.	The	teacher,	a	learned
philosopher,	was	in	full	swing:	“You	are	not	just	this	or	that;	you	are	everywhere.	There	is
nothing	like	‘yours’	and	‘mine’;	everything	is	you,	everything	is	yours.	In	essence,	everything
is	one.	What	you	see,	hear,	smell,	taste,	touch	is	not	reality;	it	is	all	 _maya,_ 	all	illusion.”

This	unbeatable	Vedanta	rhetoric	was	buzzing	in	Shankaran	Pillai’s	head.	He	went	home
and	 slept	 on	 it.	 He	 woke	 in	 the	 morning,	 totally	 fired	 up.	 Usually	 he	 loved	 to	 sleep,	 but
because	of	this	Vedanta,	he	sprang	out	of	bed.	The	first	thoughts	in	his	mind	were,	“There	is
nothing	which	is	not	mine.	Everything	is	mine;	everything	is	me.	All	that	is	in	this	world	is
me,	and	everything	is	maya.”

You	 know,	 whatever	 the	 philosophy	 may	 be,	 hunger	 happens	 at	 regular	 intervals.	 So
Shankaran	 Pillai	 went	 to	 his	 favorite	 restaurant,	 ordered	 a	 big	 breakfast,	 and	 devoured	 it,
saying	to	himself,	“The	food	is	me;	the	one	who	serves	is	also	me;	the	one	who	eats	is	also
me.”	Vedanta!

He	finished	his	breakfast.	When	he	was	in	such	a	high	state	of	Vedanta,	mundane	issues	like
paying	the	bill	did	not	occur	to	him.	He	rose	and	started	walking	out.	When	everything	is
yours,	how	can	there	be	a	bill?

As	he	passed	the	cash	counter,	the	owner	happened	to	turn	away	to	attend	to	some	other
chore.	Shankaran	Pillai	saw	a	huge	heap	of	currency	in	the	till.	Immediately,	Vedanta	told	him,
“Everything	is	yours;	you	cannot	differentiate	between	this	and	that.”	So	because	his	pockets
were	quite	empty,	he	put	his	hand	into	the	box,	took	some	cash,	stuffed	it	in	his	pocket,	and
sauntered	out	of	the	restaurant.	He	was	not	out	to	rob	anybody;	he	was	just	practicing	Vedanta.

Suddenly	a	few	people	from	the	restaurant	ran	up	and	caught	him.	Shankaran	Pillai	said,
“Who	are	you	trying	to	catch?	You	are	the	catcher	and	the	caught;	what	you	catch	is	you;	the
one	that	catches	is	also	you.	When	there	is	no	such	thing	as	you	and	me,	who	can	I	pay?”

The	owner	was	bewildered!	Only	one	thing	was	clear	to	him:	“My	cash	is	in	your	pocket.”
But	here	was	Shankaran	Pillai	saying,	“The	one	who	catches	is	also	me,	the	one	who	is	caught
is	also	me.”	The	owner	didn’t	know	how	to	deal	with	this	kind	of	customer.	At	his	wits’	end,
he	took	Shankaran	Pillai	to	court.


There,	Shankaran	Pillai	continued	his	Vedanta.	The	judge	tried	in	many	ways	to	make	him
understand	that	he	had	committed	a	theft,	but	to	no	avail.	Then	the	judge	gave	up	and	said,
“Okay,	ten	lashes	on	the	backside.”

First	lash...Shankaran	Pillai	screamed.
The	judge	said,	“Don’t	worry.	It’s	all	maya	anyway.	There	is	no	such	thing	as	pain	and
pleasure.	Everything	is	maya.”

Second	lash...Shankaran	Pillai	shouted,	“Enough!”
The	judge	said,	“The	one	who	lashes	is	you,	the	one	who	is	lashed	is	also	you.”
Third	lash...Shankaran	Pillai	hollered,	“Stop	stop!”
“There	is	no	such	thing	as	starting	and	stopping.	It	is	all	maya.”
It	was	like	this	all	the	way	to	ten	lashes.	But	before	the	ten	were	done,	Vedanta	had	been
cleaned	right	out	of	Shankaran	Pillai.

An	intellectual	understanding	that	is	not	backed	by	experiential	knowledge	can	lead	to	mind
games	and	deceptive	states.	But	if	oneness	becomes	an	experiential	reality,	it	will	not	produce
an	 immature	 action.	 It	 will	 produce	 a	 tremendous	 experience	 of	 life	 that	 will	 leave	 you
transformed	forever.

Universality	is	not	an	idea;	it	is	an	existential	truth.	It	is	individuality	that	is	an	idea.	Yoga	is
simply	 _chitta	vritti	nirodha._ 	That	means,	if	the	activity	of	your	mind	ceases	and	you	are	still
alert,	you	are	in	yoga.

But	don’t	try	to	forcibly	stop	the	mental	activity	because	you	will	go	insane.	With	your
mind,	all	the	three	pedals	are	throttles;	there	are	no	brakes	and	no	clutch.	Have	you	noticed
this?	Whatever	pedal	you	hit,	the	mind	only	accelerates	its	speed.	But	if	you	don’t	pay	any
attention	to	it,	thoughts	will	slowly	subside,	leaving	you	in	a	rich	and	vibrant	silence.

Sadhana

```
Remind	yourself	at	least	once	an	hour	that	everything	you’re	carrying—your	handbag,	your	money,	your
relationships,	the	heaviness	in	your	heart	and	body—are	things	that	you’ve	accumulated	over	a	period	of
time.	 If	 you	 become	 more	 and	 more	 conscious	 of	 this	 fundamental	 fact	 even	 as	 a	 process	 of	 dis-
identification	grows	within	you—balanced	by	a	deep	sense	of	involvement	in	everything	around	you—you
will	move	from	the	misery	and	madness	of	the	human	mind	toward	meditativeness.
```

**Thinking	Yourself	Out	of	Life**

It	is	only	because	you	exist	that	you	can	generate	a	thought.	But	your	thought	process	has
become	so	compulsive	that	your	focus	has	shifted	from	the	existential	to	the	psychological.
This	has	happened	to	such	an	extent	that	you	have	begun	to	believe	that	you	exist	because	you
think!	 The	 foundations	 of	 Western	 philosophy	 actually	 rest	 on	 the	 famous	 axiom	 by	 the
seventeenth-century	French	philosopher	René	Descartes:	“I	think,	therefore	I	am.”

It	is	time	to	restate	a	fundamental	fact:	 _you	are,	therefore	you_ 	may	 _think._ 	This	has	nothing	to
do	with	any	philosophy,	Eastern	or	Western.	It	is	a	simple	existential	reality.

You	can	“be,”	and	still	choose	to	think	or	not	think.	The	most	beautiful	moments	in	your
life—what	you	might	consider	moments	of	bliss,	joy,	ecstasy,	or	utter	peace—were	moments
when	you	were	not	thinking	about	anything	at	all.	You	were	just	 _being_ .	Even	without	your
thoughts,	existence	 _is_.

What	are	thoughts	really?	Just	information	that	you	have	gathered	and	recycled.	Are	you
really	capable	of	thinking	of	anything	other	than	what	has	been	accumulated	by	your	mind?
All	the	human	mind	is	doing	is	recycling	old	data.

So	I	ask:	Do	you	want	to	be	a	living	being	or	a	thinking	being?	Right	now,	ninety	percent	of
the	time,	you	are	only	thinking	about	life,	not	living	it.	Have	you	come	into	this	world	to
experience	life	or	to	think	about	it?	Your	mental	process	is	a	very	small	happening	compared
to	the	life	process,	but	right	now	it	has	become	far	more	important.	It	is	time	for	humanity	to
shift	the	significance	to	the	life	process	once	again.	The	need	is	an	urgent	one.	Our	lives
depend	on	it.

Once	it	happened...(This	is	almost	certainly	an	apocryphal	tale,	but	that	doesn’t	matter;	it
smells	true.)	Aristotle,	the	father	of	modern	logic,	the	intellectual	giant	of	ancient	Greece,	was
walking	on	the	beach.	A	glorious	sunset	was	before	him,	but	he	had	no	time	for	such	petty
occurrences.	 He	 was	 thinking	 seriously	 about	 some	 great	 problem	 of	 existence.	 For	 the
intellectual	mind,	existence	is	always	a	problem,	and	Aristotle	was	out	to	solve	it.	Lost	in
solemn	thought,	he	paced	up	and	down	the	beach.

There	 was	 another	 man	 on	 the	 beach	 who	 was	 doing	 something	 very	 intensely—so
intensely	that	after	a	while	even	Aristotle	noticed	him.	Those	who	are	immersed	in	their	own
psychological	realities	usually	end	up	ignoring	life	around	them.	They	seldom	have	the	eyes
to	look	at	a	flower,	a	sunset,	a	child,	or	a	smiling	face.	And	if	it	is	an	unsmiling	face,	they
have	no	inclination	to	make	it	smile;	they	have	no	such	small	duties	or	minor	cares	in	the
world!	They	are	too	busy	cracking	the	great	puzzles	of	existence.

But	 this	 man’s	 intensity	 was	 such	 that	 even	 Aristotle	 could	 not	 ignore	 him.	 On	 close
observation	he	noticed	that	this	man	kept	going	to	the	ocean	and	returning,	with	great	single-
mindedness	of	purpose.	Aristotle	paused	in	his	reflections	to	inquire,	“What	exactly	are	you


up	to?”

The	 man	 said,	 “Please	 don’t	 disturb	 me,	 I	 am	 doing	 something	 very	 important.”	 He
continued	with	his	work	with	furious	intensity.

Aristotle’s	curiosity	was	piqued.	He	asked	again,	“But	what	are	you	doing?”
The	man	said,	“Don’t	disturb	me.	It	is	very	important.”
Aristotle	said,	“What	 _is_ 	this	important	thing?”
The	man	showed	him	a	little	hole	he	had	dug	in	the	sand,	and	said,	“I	am	emptying	the
ocean	into	this	hole.”	He	had	a	tablespoon	in	his	hand.

Aristotle	looked	at	this	and	laughed.	Now,	Aristotle	is	the	kind	who	can	spend	a	whole	year
without	 a	 single	 chuckle.	 It	 takes	 a	 heart	 to	 laugh.	 The	 intellect	 cannot	 laugh;	 it	 can	 only
dissect.

But	even	Aristotle	laughed	at	this	and	said,	“This	is	ridiculous!	You	must	be	insane.	Do	you
know	how	vast	this	ocean	is?	How	can	you	ever	empty	this	ocean	into	this	little	hole?	And
above	all,	with	a	tablespoon?	At	least	if	you	had	a	bucket,	you	might	have	stood	some	chance!
Please	give	this	up.	This	is	utter	madness.”

The	man	looked	at	Aristotle,	threw	the	spoon	down,	and	said,	“My	job	is	already	done.”
Aristotle	said,	“What	do	you	mean?	Forget	about	the	ocean	being	empty;	even	the	hole	is
not	full.	How	is	your	job	done?”

The	other	man	stood	up	and	said,	“I	am	trying	to	empty	the	ocean	into	this	hole	with	a
tablespoon.	You	are	telling	me	it	is	madness.	But	what	are	 _you_ 	trying	to	do?	Do	you	know	how
vast	this	existence	is?	It	can	contain	a	billion	oceans	like	this	and	more,	and	you	are	trying	to
empty	it	into	the	small	hole	of	your	head—and	with	what?	With	tablespoons	called	thoughts!
Please	give	it	up.	It’s	utterly	ridiculous.”

The	other	man	was	Heraclitus,	the	other	great	Greek	philosopher.	In	a	flash,	he	showed
Aristotle	what	a	crippled	existence	he	was	leading	by	attempting	to	extend	his	logic	to	every
aspect	of	life.

If	you	want	to	know	the	experiential	dimensions	of	life,	you	will	never	know	them	with	the
petty	process	of	thought.	Even	if	you	have	the	brain	of	an	Einstein,	your	thought	process	is
still	 outclassed	 because	 thought	 cannot	 be	 bigger	 than	 life.	 Thought	 can	 only	 be	 logical,
functioning	 between	 two	 polarities.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 know	 life	 in	 its	 immensity,	 you	 need
something	more	than	the	intellect.

This	is	the	fundamental	choice	you	have:	either	you	learn	to	live	with	creation,	or	you
manufacture	your	own	creation	in	your	head.

Which	option	do	you	want	to	exercise?
The	planet	is	spinning	on	time:	not	a	small	event.	All	the	galaxies	are	managing	fine;	the
whole	cosmos	is	doing	great.	But	you	have	one	nasty	little	thought	crawling	through	your
head,	and	it	is	a	bad	day!	The	problem	is	you	are	living	in	a	psychological	space	that	bears	no
connection	with	reality.	And	you	are	insecure,	because	it	can	collapse	at	any	moment.

In	the	vastness	and	grandeur	of	cosmic	space,	if	you	look	at	yourself	in	perspective,	you
are	less	than	a	speck	of	dust.	But	you	think	 _your_ 	thought—which	is	less	than	a	speck	within


you—should	determine	the	nature	of	existence!	You	have	lost	your	perspective	of	life:	that	is
the	basic	problem.

You	 have	 heard	 of	 the	 “Buddha.”	 His	 name	 was	 Siddhartha	 Gautama,	 and	 he	 _became_ a
Buddha.	 But	 Gautama	 was	 not	 the	 only	 Buddha.	 A	 human	 being	 who	 has	 transcended	 his
intellect,	the	discriminatory	and	logical	dimensions	of	his	life,	is	a	Buddha.	Human	beings
have	invented	millions	of	ways	to	suffer.	For	all	this	the	manufacturing	unit	is	just	in	your
mind.	 Once	 you	 are	 no	 longer	 identified	 with	 your	 mind,	 you	 are	 free	 to	 experience	 life
beyond	 limitations.	 Being	 a	 Buddha	 means	 that	 you	 have	 become	 a	 witness	 to	 your	 own
intellect.

The	essence	of	yoga,	as	we	have	said	before,	is	just	this—to	arrive	at	that	moment	where
there	is	a	clear	space	between	you	and	your	mind.	Once	this	happens,	a	life	of	heightened
clarity,	perception,	and	freedom	has	begun.	This	is	the	birth	of	freedom.


```
LIMITS	OF	LOGIC
```
Without	logical	thinking,	you	couldn’t	survive	on	this	planet.	But	at	the	same
time,	too	much	logic	is	suicide.	Let	us	say	you	wake	up	tomorrow	morning
and	start	thinking	a	hundred	percent	logically.	Do	not	think	about	the	sunrise,
the	birds	in	the	sky,	your	child’s	face,	the	flowers	blooming	in	your	garden.
Just	think	logically.	Now,	you	have	to	get	up,	go	to	the	toilet,	brush	your	teeth,
eat,	work,	eat,	work,	eat,	sleep.	Again,	tomorrow	morning	the	same	thing.	For
the	next	thirty,	forty,	or	fifty	years,	you	have	to	do	the	same	thing.	If	you	think
a	hundred	percent	logically,	there	is	no	reason	for	you	to	be	alive!

One	 day	 in	 New	 York	 City,	 a	 man	 was	 walking	 home,	 late	 from	 work.
Suddenly	he	had	a	romantic	idea.	He	went	to	the	florist,	bought	a	huge	bunch
of	red	roses,	went	home,	and	knocked	on	the	door.	His	wife	opened	the	door.

She	looked	at	him	and	started	hollering.	“Today	has	been	a	terrible	day.	The
faucet	has	been	leaking,	the	basement	is	flooded,	the	children	had	a	food	fight,
and	I	had	to	clean	the	whole	place,	the	dog	has	been	sick,	my	mother	is	not
well,	and	you	have	the	cheek	to	come	home	 _drunk_ !”

So	if	you	think	a	hundred	percent	logically,	there	is	really	no	possibility	of
life!	Moments	of	extreme	logic	are	moments	of	suicide.	Only	if	you	know
when	logic	should	be	used	and	when	it’s	necessary	to	go	beyond	it,	will	your
life	be	beautiful.


Sadhana

You	could	try	this	simple	practice.	Set	your	tap	in	such	a	way	that	only	five	to	ten	drops	fall	per	minute.
See	if	you	can	observe	each	drop—how	it	forms,	how	it	falls,	how	it	splashes	on	the	ground.	Do	this	for
fifteen	to	twenty	minutes	a	day.	You	will	gradually	become	conscious	of	many	things	around	and	within
you	 that	 you	 are	 completely	 unaware	 of	 right	 now.	 This	 simple	 exercise	 can	 initiate	 a	 process	 of
sensitization	and	clarity	and	accomplish	much	more	than	you	can	possibly	imagine.	In	this	simple	process,
you	are	actually	exploring	one	limb	of	yoga	referred	to	as	 _dharana,_ 	which	means	“that	which	flows.”	It	is
not	the	water	we	are	referring	to	here.	It	is	your	attention,	and,	in	turn,	your	consciousness.	The	attempt	is
to	make	your	attention	flow	and	connect	with	its	object—in	this	case,	water.	This	is	not	an	exercise	in
observation	or	appreciation.	It	is	an	exercise	in	attention—in	turning	what	is	sporadic	and	intermittent	into	a
flow.	(In	the	larger	scheme	of	things,	the	water	and	you	are	already	one.	Your	individuality	is	only	your
idea.)


**The	Grime	of	Identity**

The	intellect	is	like	a	scalpel.	Its	function	is	to	slice	through	reality	and	enable	you	to	discern
one	thing	from	another.	If	a	knife	has	to	cut	through	anything	effortlessly,	it	is	important	that
the	 substance	 it	 encounters	 does	 not	 stick	 to	 it.	 A	 sticky	 knife	 is	 obviously	 an	 ineffective
implement.

Suppose	you	use	a	knife	to	cut	a	cake	today;	tomorrow	you	cut	meat;	and	the	day	after
tomorrow	you	cut	fruit.	If	all	these	residues	were	to	stick	to	the	knife,	it	would	turn	over	time
into	a	useless	instrument.	You’ve	probably	experienced	this	already:	if	you	cut	mangoes	or
apples	after	cutting	an	onion,	everything	tastes	like	onion!	Such	a	knife	becomes	more	of	a
hindrance	than	a	help.	In	other	words,	once	your	intellect	gets	identified	with	something,	it
gets	chained	to	the	identifications,	and	leaves	you	with	a	completely	distorted	experience	of
the	world.

Once	it	happened...For	political	reasons,	Akbar,	the	great	emperor,	was	separated	in	his
infancy	from	his	mother.	Another	woman	who	had	a	child	of	her	own	was	brought	in	to	nurse
him.	This	woman	breastfed	Akbar,	and	was	later	offered	a	reward	for	her	services.	Her	boy,
who	was	still	a	child,	slightly	older	than	Akbar,	was	allotted	a	few	villages	and	was	made	a
small	 ruler.	 Many	 years	 later,	 Akbar	 was	 crowned	 emperor.	 But	 this	 boy,	 who	 lacked	 the
intelligence	and	capability	required	of	a	ruler,	squandered	all	his	resources,	lost	all	that	was
given	to	him,	and	grew	impoverished.

One	day,	when	he	was	about	thirty-two	years	of	age,	a	grand	idea	occurred	to	him.	He
thought,	“Since	the	emperor	and	I	drank	the	same	mother’s	milk,	we	are	brothers.	And	since	I
was	born	first,	I	am	the	elder	brother!”

With	this	idea	planted	firmly	in	his	head,	he	went	to	Akbar	and	told	him	the	same	story.
“See,	we	are	brothers,	and	I	am	elder	to	you.	But	look	at	my	sorry	state:	I	am	poor,	you	are	an
emperor!	How	can	you	leave	me	like	this?”

Akbar	was	deeply	moved.	He	welcomed	him,	set	him	up	in	the	palace,	and	treated	him	like	a
king.	 The	 man	 was	 not	 accustomed	 to	 the	 ways	 of	 the	 court,	 and	 committed	 many	 stupid
blunders.	But	the	generous	Akbar	kept	saying,	“He	is	my	elder	brother.	We	have	drunk	the
milk	of	the	same	mother.”	He	introduced	him	to	everybody	as	his	elder	brother.

This	was	the	state	of	affairs	for	some	time.	Then	it	was	time	for	the	man	to	return	to	his
village	for	some	work.	Akbar	said,	“My	brother,	you	lost	those	villages	given	to	you.	I	shall
give	you	five	new	villages	to	rule—a	small	kingdom	of	your	own.”

The	man	said,	“But	I	see	that	you	have	become	this	successful	because	there	are	lots	of
smart	people	around	you.	I	don’t	have	anybody	to	advise	me,	and	that	is	why	I’m	lost.	If	only	I
had	good	advisers	and	ministers,	I	would	also	have	built	a	major	empire.	Above	all,	you	have
Birbal!	He’s	so	smart.	If	only	I	had	somebody	like	him	I	would	also	be	a	great	emperor.”


The	large-hearted	Akbar	said,	“If	you	wish,	you	may	take	Birbal	with	you.”
He	summoned	Birbal	and	ordered	him,	“You	must	go	with	my	elder	brother.”
Birbal	said,	“Your	Highness,	your	elder	brother	deserves	someone	better	than	me.	Why	not
_my_ 	elder	brother?	I	could	send	him	instead.”

Akbar	thought	that	was	a	great	idea	because	he	did	not	relish	the	prospect	of	losing	Birbal.
Delighted,	he	said,	“Summon	him	immediately.”

The	 next	 day	 this	 man	 was	 to	 leave	 for	 his	 new	 kingdom,	 and	 a	 grand	 farewell	 was
organized	in	court.	There	was	a	mood	of	anticipation	in	the	air,	as	everyone	waited	for	Birbal
to	arrive	with	his	elder	brother.

Finally,	Birbal	entered	with	a	bull	in	tow.
“What	is	 _this_ ?”	Akbar	asked.
Birbal	said,	“This	is	my	elder	brother.”
Akbar	was	furious.	“Are	you	trying	to	insult	me	and	my	brother?”
“No,	my	lord,”	said	Birbal.	“He	 _is_ 	my	elder	brother.	Both	of	us	drank	milk	from	the	same
mother.”

Once	your	intellect—or	 _buddhi,_ 	as	it	is	termed	in	the	yogic	taxonomy—gets	identified	with
something,	you	function	within	the	realm	of	this	identity.	Whatever	you	are	identified	with,	all
your	 thoughts	 and	 emotions	 spring	 from	 that	 identity.	 Right	 now	 suppose	 you	 identify
yourself	 as	 a	 man,	 all	 your	 thoughts	 and	 emotions	 flow	 from	 that	 identification.	 If	 you
identify	yourself	with	your	nationality	or	religion,	they	will	flow	from	those	identifications.
Whatever	your	thoughts	and	emotions,	these	identifications	are	a	certain	level	of	prejudice.	In
fact,	your	mind	is	itself	a	certain	kind	of	prejudice.	Why?	Because	it	functions	from	limited
data	and	is	fronted	by	an	essentially	discriminatory	intellect.	So,	your	mind,	which	should
have	 been	 a	 ladder	 to	 the	 divine,	 is	 stumbling	 through	 endless	 mediocrity	 and,	 on	 some
occasions,	has	become	a	straight	stairway	to	hell.

The	identity	around	which	the	intellect	functions	is	called	 _ahankara_ .	To	continue	with	the
earlier	knife	analogy,	the	hand	that	wields	the	knife	is	identity.	Or	in	other	words,	it	is	your
identity	that	manages	and	determines	your	intellect.	When	you	use	a	knife,	it	is	important	not
just	to	have	a	sharp	blade,	but	a	stable	hand	to	hold	it.	Without	a	stable	hand	you	can	end	up
cutting	yourself	in	a	million	different	ways.	Most	of	the	suffering	human	beings	undergo	is
not	because	of	external	situations.	What	is	inflicted	on	them	from	the	outside	is	minimal;	the
rest	is	all	self-help!

Once	you	are	identified	with	something	that	you	are	not,	the	mind	is	an	express	train	that
cannot	be	stopped.	If	you	put	the	mind	on	full	steam	and	want	to	apply	the	brakes,	it	will	not
work.	But	if	you	are	able	to	disentangle	yourself	from	everything	that	you	are	not—if	you
dis-identify,	as	it	were—you	will	see	that	the	mind	turns	just	blank	and	empty.	When	you	want
to	use	it,	you	can;	at	other	times,	it	will	simply	be	empty,	devoid	of	all	psychological	clutter.
That	is	how	it	should	be.	But	right	now,	you	are	identified	with	so	many	labels,	and	at	the
same	time	you	are	trying	to	stop	your	mind:	this	will	simply	not	work.

```
Irrespective	of	what	you	think	you	are,	when	death	confronts	you,	every	identification	falls
```

away.	If	human	beings	learned	to	drop	these	voluntarily,	life	would	be	blissful.	If	you	do	not
encumber	 your	 intellect	 with	 any	 identifications—body,	 gender,	 family,	 qualifications,
society,	race,	caste,	creed,	community,	nation,	even	species—you	travel	naturally	toward	your
ultimate	nature.	If	not,	death	will	demolish	it	all	anyway.	You	need	have	no	doubt	about	that!

If	you	employ	your	intelligence	and	make	an	attempt	to	reach	your	ultimate	nature,	this	is
called	gnana	yoga,	or	the	yoga	of	knowing.	Gnana	yogis	cannot	afford	to	identify	themselves
with	anything.	If	they	do,	that	is	the	end	of	their	journey.	But	unfortunately,	what	has	happened
to	 gnana	 yoga,	 at	 least	 in	 India,	 is	 that	 its	 proponents	 entertain	 several	 beliefs.	 “I	 am	 the
Universal	Soul,	the	Absolute,	the	Supreme	Being”—they	know	it	all,	from	the	arrangement	of
the	cosmos	to	the	shape	and	size	of	the	soul!	They	have	read	all	these	things	in	a	book.	This	is
_not_ 	gnana	yoga.	Any	information	you	have	about	that	which	is	not	a	living	experience	for
you,	is	irrelevance.	Maybe	it	is	very	holy	irrelevance,	but	it	does	not	liberate	you;	it	only
entangles	you!

On	a	certain	day,	a	bull	was	grazing	on	a	field.	He	went	deep	into	the	forest,	and	after	weeks
of	grazing	on	lush	grass,	became	nice	and	fat.	A	lion,	who	was	past	his	prime	and	having
difficulty	hunting	his	prey,	saw	this	nice	fat	bull,	pounced	on	him,	killed	him,	and	ate	him	up.
His	stomach	became	full.	Then	with	great	satisfaction,	he	roared.	A	few	hunters	were	passing
by.	They	heard	the	roar,	tracked	him	down,	and	shot	him	dead.

Moral	of	the	story:	when	you	are	so	full	of	bull	you	should	not	open	your	mouth.
Very	few	people	have	the	necessary	intellect	to	pursue	gnana	yoga	one	hundred	percent.
Most	 need	 a	 huge	 amount	 of	 preparation.	 There	 is	 an	 entire	 yogic	 process	 to	 make	 your
intellect	 so	 razor-sharp	 that	 it	 does	 not	 stick	 to	 anything.	 But	 it	 is	 very	 time-consuming
because	the	mind	is	a	tricky	customer;	it	is	capable	of	creating	a	million	illusions.	Gnana
yoga	as	a	part	of	your	spiritual	pursuit	is	a	workable	proposition;	as	an	exclusive	path,	it	is
only	for	a	very	rare	few.

```
Just	sit	alone	for	an	hour.	No	reading,	no	television,	no	phone,	no	communication,	nothing.	Just	see	in	the
course	of	this	hour	what	thoughts	dominate	your	mind—whether	it	is	food,	sex,	your	car,	your	furniture,
your	 jewelry,	 or	 anything	 else.	 If	 you	 find	 yourself	 thinking	 recurrently	 about	 people	 or	 things,	 your
identification	is	essentially	with	your	body.	If	your	thoughts	are	about	what	you	would	like	to	do	in	the
world,	your	identification	is	essentially	with	your	mind.	Everything	else	is	just	a	complex	set	of	offshoots
of	these	two	aspects.	This	is	not	a	value	judgment.	It	is	just	a	way	of	knowing	what	stage	of	life	you’re	at.
How	quickly	you	want	to	evolve	depends	on	your	own	choices.
```

**Soak	the	Intellect	in	Awareness**

In	the	yogic	system	of	classification,	the	mind	has	sixteen	dimensions.	These	sixteen	fall	into
four	 categories.	 There	 is	 the	 _discerning,_ or	 discriminatory,	 dimension	 of	 the	 mind	 or	 the
intellect	 ( _buddhi_ );	 the	 _accumulative_ dimension	 of	 the	 mind,	 or	 memory	 ( _manas_ ),	 which
gathers	information;	and	what	is	called	 _awareness_ 	( _chitta_ ),	which	is	beyond	both	intellect	and
memory.	The	fourth	dimension,	 _ahankara_ ,	we	discussed	earlier—the	aspect	of	the	mind	from
which	you	derive	your	sense	of	identity.

The	first	dimension—the	intellect,	buddhi—is	crucial	for	your	survival.	You	are	able	to
discern	a	person	from	a	tree	only	because	your	intellect	is	functional.	You	know	that	you	must
walk	through	the	door,	not	through	the	wall,	only	because	your	intellect	is	functional.	Without
this	dimension	of	discernment,	you	would	not	know	how	to	survive	on	this	planet.	On	more
complex	and	sophisticated	levels,	the	intellect	has	contributed	immeasurably	to	human	culture
and	civilization.

The	problem	of	our	times,	however,	is	that	the	intellect	has	taken	on	a	disproportionately
important	role.	Modern	education	has	encouraged	a	completely	lopsided	development	of	this
aspect	of	the	mind.	The	essence	of	the	intellect	is	to	divide.	So	humanity	has	embarked	on	a
journey	of	wholesale	division,	discrimination,	and	dissection.	We	have	split	everything.	Even
the	invisible	atom	has	been	split.

Once	you	unleash	the	intellect,	it	splits	everything	it	encounters;	it	does	not	allow	you	to	 _be_
with	anything	totally.	Although	it	is	a	wonderful	instrument	for	survival,	it	is	also	at	the	same
time	a	terrible	barrier	that	stands	between	you	and	your	experience	of	the	oneness	of	life.

How	do	we	address	this	problem?
Yoga	offers	us	a	way.	In	our	times,	it	is	not	just	a	useful	strategy;	it	is	perhaps	our	 _only_
chance	of	reversing	a	journey	that	seems	to	be	taking	us	headlong	toward	self-destruction.

The	 intellect	 is	 becoming	 a	 barrier	 because	 you	 keep	 it	 constantly	 dipped	 in	 the
accumulative	part	of	the	mind—your	memory,	manas.	Examine	this	for	yourself.	You	will
find	 that	 _every_ thought	 that	 arises	 in	 the	 mind	 has	 its	 roots	 in	 data	 you	 have	 already
accumulated.	 The	 data	 may	 be	 gathered	 consciously	 or	 unconsciously.	 In	 any	 case,	 this
basically	means	your	intellect	is	perpetually	immersed	in	the	past.	In	such	a	state,	nothing	new
is	now	possible.	And	so,	the	intellect	loses	its	edge	and	becomes	a	trap.

The	 accumulative	 part	 of	 the	 mind	 is,	 to	 put	 it	 simply,	 just	 society’s	 garbage	 bin.	 It	 is
merely	a	heap	of	impressions	you	have	gathered	from	outside.	Anybody	you	encounter	stuffs
something	into	your	head	and	moves	on:	your	parents,	teachers,	friends,	enemies,	preachers,
the	news	anchor	on	TV,	just	about	everyone.	You	have	no	choice	about	who	to	receive	from
and	who	not	to	receive	from.	The	moment	you	say	“I	don’t	like	this	person,”	you	often	end	up
receiving	much	more	from	him	or	her	than	anybody	else!	You	have	the	ability	to	process	the


information	you	receive,	but	that	is	all.	Your	ability	to	merely	recycle	the	garbage	you	have
picked	up	is	what	the	mighty	intellect	has	been	reduced	to.

The	blitzkrieg	of	information	that	your	mind	receives	daily	enters	you	only	through	your
five	sense	organs.	Your	sense	organs,	as	we	have	seen	before,	always	perceive	everything
only	in	comparison.	Where	there	is	comparison,	there	is	always	duality.	Suppose	I	were	to
show	you	my	hand.	While	you	are	able	to	see	one	side,	you	cannot	see	the	other.	If	I	were	to
show	you	the	other	side,	you	would	not	be	able	to	perceive	this	first	side.	Human	perception
through	the	sense	organs	is	always	piecemeal.	It	can	give	you	an	illusion	of	completeness	but
can	never	comprehend	the	whole.

When	you	keep	your	intellect	dipped	in	this	limited,	fragmented,	accumulative	dimension
of	your	mind,	you	draw	conclusions	about	life	that	are	completely	distorted.	The	more	people
become	engrossed	in	thought,	the	more	joyless	they	become.	It	is	unfortunate.	But	let	me	be
clear:	 thought	 in	 itself	 is	 not	 a	 problem.	 People	 who	 think	 with	 clarity	 should	 be	 joyful.
Unfortunately,	 for	 many	 people,	 the	 more	 they	 think,	 the	 more	 incapable	 they	 become	 of
smiling!	 The	 problem	 is	 just	 that	 they	 have	 enslaved	 their	 faculty	 of	 discernment	 to	 the
limitations	of	their	sense	perception.

But	the	same	intellect	can	be	sharpened	if	you	allow	it	to	soak	in	the	other	aspect	of	your
mind—your	awareness,	chitta.	If	you	want	to	reach	your	ultimate	nature	through	the	mind,
you	need	to	make	the	intellect	 _truly_ 	discriminatory,	in	the	ultimate	sense.	This	does	not	mean
dividing	 everything	 into	 good	 and	 bad,	 right	 and	 wrong,	 high	 and	 low,	 heaven	 and	 hell,
sacred	and	profane.	Instead,	all	it	means	is	learning	to	 _discern	the	real	from	the	illusory, what
is	existentially	true	from	what	is	psychologically	true_.

If	you	soak	your	intellect	in	your	awareness,	the	discerning	dimension	of	your	mind	can
turn	into	a	miraculous	tool	of	liberation.	It	can	become	razor-sharp,	slice	through	what	is	true
and	untrue,	and	deliver	you	to	a	different	dimension	of	life	altogether.

Learn	to	place	your	intellect	in	the	sheath	of	your	awareness	rather	than	in	the	sack	of
memory	 and	 identification.	 Once	 you	 do,	 this	 tremendous	 instrument	 can	 cut	 its	 way
effortlessly	toward	the	ultimate.

Sadhana

```
If	you	consciously	walk	a	tightrope,	you	have	no	choice	but	to	be	aware.	If	your	intellect	is	constantly
choosing	between	good	and	bad,	it	has	become	a	prejudiced	intellect.	And	when	it	is	busy	sorting	the
world	into	good	and	bad,	you	will	most	definitely	fall	off	the	tightrope.	Don’t	take	the	tightrope	literally.
You	could	just	try	bringing	a	certain	precision	into	the	physical	movements	of	the	body.	(If	you	have	a
hatha	yoga	practice,	it	should	happen	anyway.)	For	instance,	if	you	see	a	straight	line	on	the	floor,	try
walking	 in	 perfect	 alignment	 with	 that	 line,	 maintaining	 an	 easy	 gait.	 This	 is	 not	 about	 becoming	 self-
conscious,	but	about	becoming	precise	or	exact.	Try	this	with	your	body	and	see.	Bring	precision	into	every
movement,	every	gesture.	This	is	one	way	of	dipping	your	intellect	in	awareness.
```

**Awareness	Is	Aliveness**

What	do	we	mean	by	the	word	“awareness,”	anyway?	What	does	it	signify?	And	how	can	we
access	it?

First	and	foremost,	let	us	make	an	important	distinction:	awareness	is	not	mental	alertness.
Mental	 alertness	 will	 only	 enhance	 your	 ability	 to	 survive	 in	 the	 world.	 It	 is	 a	 doglike
alertness—useful	in	self-preservation	but	not	in	self-expansion.	Awareness	is	not	something
that	you	 _do._ 	Awareness	is	what	you	are.	Awareness	is	aliveness.

The	dimension	of	the	mind	that	modern	societies	have	completely	ignored	at	their	own
peril	is	awareness,	or	chitta.	This	is	intelligence	that	is	completely	unsullied	by	memory.	This
is	the	deepest	dimension	of	the	mind	and	one	that	connects	you	with	that	which	is	the	very
basis	of	creation.	When	you	are	in	touch	with	this	dimension,	you	are	in	a	state	of	heightened
awareness,	which	allows	you	to	be	fully	conscious	and	intoxicated	at	the	same	time—and	with
no	external	stimulus	whatsoever!	When	you	learn	to	access	chitta,	being	blissful	is	entirely
natural.

Sleep,	wakefulness,	death—these	are	all	just	different	levels	of	awareness.	Suppose	you
were	dozing	and	somebody	shook	you	awake.	 _Boom!_ 	The	whole	world	comes	back	in	a	single
moment!	That	is	not	a	small	thing.	You	re-created	the	whole	of	existence	instantly.	The	world,
which	was	obliterated	in	your	experience,	pops	back.	Not	in	seven	days— _in	just	a	moment_.

How	do	you	know	whether	the	world	exists	or	not?	Only	by	your	experience.	There	is	no
other	proof.	So,	awareness	is	that	which	can	either	create	or	obliterate	this	existence.	That	is
the	magic	of	awareness.

You	can	pitch	your	awareness	up	to	different	levels.	As	you	notch	it	up	further	and	further,
whole	 new	 dimensions	 of	 existence	 open	 up	 in	 your	 experience.	 Worlds	 that	 nobody	 had
imagined	in	their	wildest	possible	dreams	become	a	living	reality	for	you.

When	you	are	asleep,	the	world	does	not	exist	because	you	are	largely	unaware.	But	even	in
sleep,	you	are	not	completely	unaware.	The	difference	between	a	sleeping	person	and	a	dead
person	 is	 one	 of	 awareness.	 Similarly,	 between	 a	 wakeful	 person	 and	 an	 awakened	 or
enlightened	person,	there	is	a	difference.	An	awakened	person	sleeps	too,	but	has	managed	so
much	awareness	that	some	part	of	him	or	her	does	not	sleep.	The	sense	organs	shut	down,	the
body	rests	a	bit,	but	everything	else	is	on.	This	is	because	awareness	has	been	notched	up	to
another	level.

Awareness	 is	 a	 process	 of	 inclusiveness,	 a	 way	 of	 embracing	 this	 entire	 existence.	 You
cannot	 _do_ 	it,	but	you	can	set	the	right	conditions	so	that	it	happens.	Don’t	try	to	 _be_ 	aware.	It
will	 not	 work.	 If	 you	 keep	 your	 body,	 thought,	 emotion,	 and	 energies	 properly	 aligned,
awareness	will	blossom.	You	will	become	far	more	alive	than	you	are	right	now.

```
When	you	are	consciously	in	touch	with	your	awareness,	you	gain	access	to	the	subtlest
```

dimension	of	physicality,	or	 _akash_ .	As	we	have	seen	before,	the	universe	is	just	a	play	of	five
elements—water,	fire,	earth,	air,	and	ether.	Creation	is	just	a	frolic	of	these	five.	It	is	ether	that
we	refer	to	as	“akash _”_ 	in	yogic	terminology,	and	each	human	being	has	a	certain	dimension
of	this	fifth	element	around	him	or	her.	While	the	other	elements	are	within	the	body,	the
akashic,	 or	 etheric,	 dimension	 envelops	 the	 physical	 body—usually	 up	 to	 a	 distance	 of
eighteen	to	twenty-one	inches.	Because	this	element	is	still	physical,	it	carries	information.
Anything	that	happens	at	a	certain	level	of	intensity	or	profundity	in	your	life	is	written	into
this	field	of	akash	around	you.

When	 you	 gain	 conscious	 access	 to	 your	 awareness,	 you	 gain	 access	 to	 the	 akashic
dimension	around	your	body,	as	also	to	the	akashic	dimension	around	the	planet,	the	solar
system,	and	the	entire	universe.	Without	any	of	the	instruments	of	modern	technology,	the
ancients	 in	 India	 and	 some	 other	 parts	 of	 the	 world	 amassed	 a	 remarkable	 amount	 of
knowledge	about	the	cosmos.	All	this	was	gleaned	through	the	dimension	of	 _chidakash,_ 	or	the
akashic	dimension	of	our	intelligence.

Once	you	are	in	touch	with	your	awareness,	you	don’t	have	to	 _try_ 	to	accomplish	anything.
You	don’t	even	have	to	wish	or	dream,	because	the	best	possible	thing	that	can	happen	to	you
_will_ 	happen.	In	the	yogic	lore,	it	is	said	that	when	you	learn	to	access	this	dimension,	you	have
enslaved	the	divine!	God	works	for	you	from	now	on.	What	exactly	does	this	mean?	This
means	 that	 once	 you	 distance	 yourself	 from	 the	 compulsiveness	 of	 your	 own	 genetic	 and
karmic	 information,	 life	 becomes	 unburdened,	 flexible,	 incredibly	 effortless.	 This	 is	 a
dimension	beyond	intellect,	beyond	identification,	beyond	memory,	beyond	judgment,	beyond
karma,	beyond	divisions	of	every	kind.	This	is	the	intelligence	of	existence	itself,	in	which
life	always	happens	exactly	the	way	it	should,	with	absolute	and	unfaltering	ease.

Sadhana

```
If	you	are	aware	at	the	moment	of	death,	you	will	be	aware	beyond	death	also.	Start	practicing	with	sleep.
Sleep	is	nothing	but	temporary	death.	Every	night	you	are	presented	with	a	tremendous	possibility—the
possibility	of	becoming	aware	of	the	dimension	beyond	death.
You	can	try	this	experiment	tonight.	At	the	moment	that	you	move	from	wakefulness	to	sleep,	make	an
attempt	to	be	aware.	This	practice	can	be	done	in	bed.	If	you	can	be	aware	of	the	last	moment	when	you
make	the	transition	from	wakefulness	to	sleep,	you	will	be	aware	throughout	your	sleep.
You	will	see	it	is	a	lot	of	work.	So	here	is	another	thing	you	can	do.	If	you	are	used	to	waking	up	to	an
alarm,	substitute	it	with	a	sound,	a	tune,	or	chant	that	reminds	you	of	your	awareness.	You	can	easily	train
yourself	to	make	this	association.	It	can	become	an	alarm	for	your	awareness.
Of	 course,	 you	 cannot	 use	 an	 alarm	 to	 go	 to	 sleep!	 But	 the	 fact	 of	 the	 matter	 is	 that	 unless	 you
completely	dis-identify	from	your	body,	it	is	not	easy	to	move	consciously	from	wakefulness	to	sleep.
The	first	possible	moment	that	you	come	awake,	see	if	you	can	become	consciously	aware	of	something—
your	breath	or	your	body,	for	instance.	This	will	help	you	later	when	you	want	to	go	to	bed.
If	you	achieve	waking	with	awareness	and	moving	from	wakefulness	to	sleep	in	awareness,	you	are
deathless.	This	means	that	when	it	comes	to	shedding	the	body,	you	will	do	it	in	full	awareness.	Even
getting	close	to	that	moment	will	change	the	way	your	body	and	mind	function,	and	will	alter	the	quality
```

of	your	life	quite	phenomenally.


**Knowing	Without	Thought**

Have	you	ever	watched	a	beehive	closely?	It	doesn’t	matter	whether	you	have	studied	the	most
advanced	 level	 of	 engineering,	 there	 is	 still	 something	 to	 learn	 from	 a	 beehive.	 What	 a
fabulous	feat	of	engineering	it	is!	This	is	truly	the	best	apartment	complex	you	could	imagine,
exquisitely	designed	and	structured,	and	amazingly	resilient.	In	no	kind	of	weather	have	you
ever	seen	a	beehive	falling	off	a	tree,	have	you?

Although	it	is	a	magnificent	piece	of	work,	do	the	bees	have	engineering	plans	in	their
heads?	No.	These	plans	are	there	in	their	 _bodies_ .	They	know	exactly	what	to	do	because	of	a
blueprint	in	their	systems.

Spiritual	knowledge	or	“knowing”	was	always	transmitted	like	this—not	by	thought,	not	by
word,	 but	 in	 the	 same	 way	 that	 bees	 transmit	 the	 understanding	 of	 how	 to	 build	 beehives
across	generations.	Once	this	knowing	is	transmitted	or	“downloaded,”	as	it	were,	everything
that	you	need	to	know	is	right	within	you.	When	you	download	a	certain	type	of	software	onto
your	computer,	you	don’t	have	to	understand	how	all	of	it	works.	You	don’t	have	to	read
every	word	that	is	written	in	the	software.	You	press	one	key,	and	it	produces	a	result;	another
key,	another	result.	Suddenly,	you	have	a	different	kind	of	phenomenon.

I	 make	 a	 distinction	 between	 knowledge	 and	 knowing.	 Knowledge	 is	 essentially
accumulated	information.	All	information	is	only	related	to	the	physical	nature	of	existence.
Knowing,	on	the	other	hand,	is	a	living	intelligence.	With	or	without	you,	it	still	 _is_ .	You	are
either	in	it	or	you	are	not:	that	is	the	only	choice	you	have.

There	is	an	intrinsic	intelligence	within	you	that,	as	we	have	seen	earlier,	is	capable	of
transforming	a	piece	of	bread	into	a	human	being.	The	most	sophisticated	machine,	including
the	brain,	was	created	by	this	intrinsic	intelligence.	Right	now	you	are	just	trying	to	use	a
limited	section	of	your	brain,	and	you	think	that	is	intelligence.	No.	There	is	something	within
you	that	can	create	an	entire	human	brain	in	all	its	magnificent	complexity	and	capability.	That
“something”	functions	in	an	altogether	different	way.	For	example,	I	don’t	think	with	my	head
but	with	 _every	cell	in	my	body_ .	This	makes	my	thinking	an	organic,	seamless,	and	integrated
process.	There	is	a	certain	level	of	integratedness	about	it,	because	it	involves	all	of	me.	I
don’t	have	much	thought	in	my	mind	at	all,	unless	I	choose	to	think.

Nothing	has	ever	been	out	of	place	in	this	existence.	Things	have	only	been	out	of	place	in
human	societies.	Between	this	piece	of	life	and	that	piece	of	life,	there	can	be	a	comparison.
But	for	the	intelligence	that	is	making	all	life	happen,	there	is	no	context,	no	comparison,
because	there	is	no	other.	You	cannot	say	whether	it	is	now	in	place	or	not—it	is	 _always_ 	in
place.	There	is	no	other	way	for	it	to	be.

And	the	pursuit	of	yoga	is	just	this:	moving	from	this	small	headful	of	information	to	a
cosmos	of	intelligence.	What	a	tragic	choice	people	so	often	end	up	making—choosing	the


finiteness	of	the	human	brain	over	a	universe	of	infinite	knowing.

Sadhana

```
Just	work	at	removing	from	the	mind	the	idea	that	thought	is	intelligence.	The	whole	process	of	creation,
from	a	single	atom	to	the	cosmos,	is	a	fantastic	expression	of	intelligence.	Right	now	within	your	own
body,	there	is	a	throbbing	intelligence	that	is	the	very	source	of	creation.	With	the	overrated	intellect	that
you	own,	can	you	even	understand	the	activity	of	a	single	cell	in	your	body	in	its	entirety?	The	first	step
toward	moving	from	the	trap	of	the	intellect	to	the	lap	of	a	larger	intelligence	is	to	recognize	that	every
aspect	of	life—from	a	grain	of	sand	to	a	mountain,	a	drop	to	an	ocean,	from	the	atomic	to	the	cosmic—is	a
manifestation	of	a	far	greater	intelligence	than	your	minuscule	intellect.	If	you	take	this	one	step,	life	will
start	speaking	to	you	like	never	before.
```

**Believing	versus	Seeking**

Once	it	happened...On	a	certain	day,	two	Irishmen	were	working	on	the	street,	in	front	of	a
London	brothel.	They	saw	a	Protestant	minister	coming	their	way.	He	rolled	up	his	collar,	put
his	head	down,	and	quietly	slipped	into	the	brothel.

The	two	men	looked	at	each	other	and	shrugged.	“See,	what	else	can	you	expect	from	a
Protestant?”

They	continued	to	work.	After	some	time	a	rabbi	came	by.	He	had	a	muffler	around	his
throat,	almost	covering	his	face.	He	ducked	into	the	brothel	too.	The	men	were	deeply	pained
and	shook	their	heads	sadly.	“What	has	happened?	Times	have	gone	bad.	A	religious	man	in	a
brothel!	Why	is	this	happening?”

After	a	while	the	local	bishop	came	along.	He	looked	this	way	and	that,	tightened	his	cloak
around	himself,	and	slipped	into	the	brothel.

One	of	the	men	turned	to	the	other	and	said,	“One	of	the	girls	must	be	really	sick.”
The	moment	you	get	strongly	identified,	you	lose	your	perspective	on	life!	Ideas	of	good
and	bad,	right	and	wrong	are	all	your	mental	constructs.	They	have	nothing	to	do	with	life	as
such.	What	was	considered	to	be	moral	a	hundred	years	ago	is	intolerable	today.	What	you
think	is	very	good,	your	children	despise.	Your	ideas	of	good	and	bad	are	just	a	certain	level
of	prejudice	against	life.

The	moment	you	get	identified	with	your	limited	ideas	of	morality	you	become	completely
twisted.	Your	intellect	functions	around	these	identifications	in	such	a	way	that	you	never	see
the	world	as	it	is.	If	you	want	an	element	of	spirituality	to	enter	your	life,	the	first	thing	you
must	do	is	drop	these	rigid	ideas	of	virtue	and	vice,	and	learn	to	look	at	life	just	the	way	it	is.

One	of	the	biggest	problems	in	the	world	today	is	that	right	from	a	person’s	childhood,	an
inflexible	system	of	morality	has	been	imposed	on	the	mind.	Whatever	you	consider	good,
you	naturally	get	identified	with	it.	Whatever	you	consider	bad,	you	are	naturally	repelled	by.
This	attraction	and	aversion	is	the	basis	of	all	strong	identification.	The	nature	of	your	mind
is	that	whatever	you	are	averse	to	dominates	it.	Moralists	and	preachers	have	for	generations
told	humanity	to	eschew	“evil	thoughts.”	That	is	a	surefire	strategy	to	achieve	the	reverse!
Now,	if	you	try	to	resist	that	supposedly	“evil	thought,”	it	becomes	a	full-time	job.	There	is
nothing	else	going	on	in	your	head.

The	idea	of	moral	superiority	has	been	the	source	of	too	many	inhuman	acts	to	be	ignored.
Most	people	who	believe	they	are	virtuous	are	hard	to	live	with.	Besides,	they	spend	most	of
their	lives	trying	to	avoid	what	they	consider	“wrong”	or	“sinful.”	That	usually	means	they
are	constantly	thinking	about	it.	Avoiding	something	is	not	freedom	from	it.	Such	morality	is
based	on	exclusion.	Spirituality,	on	the	other	hand,	is	born	of	inclusion.

```
The	essential	nature	of	our	humanity	has	been	so	suppressed	and	distorted	that	the	substitute
```

of	 “morality”	 has	 been	 brought	 in	 to	 bring	 some	 order	 and	 sanity	 to	 our	 lives.	 This	 has
happened	because	we	have	not	done	anything	to	keep	our	humanity	active.	If	your	humanity
were	active,	there	would	be	no	need	for	morality	at	all.

Morality	always	differs	from	person	to	person,	according	to	time,	place,	situation—and
convenience.	But	wherever	humanity	has	found	its	expression,	at	any	time	in	history	or	in	any
culture	in	the	world,	it	has	always	been	the	same	and	will	always	be.	On	a	superficial	level,	in
terms	of	our	values,	morals,	and	ethics,	each	one	of	us	may	be	different.	But	if	you	know	how
to	pierce	a	person	deep	enough	to	touch	this	humanity,	each	one	of	us	is	the	same.

To	impose	morality,	you	don’t	need	any	involvement	with	people;	you	just	have	to	dole	out
the	diktats:	“Be	good;	speak	kindly;	if	you	speak	in	anger,	the	consequences	will	be	dire,”	and
so	forth.	But	if	you	want	to	kindle	the	humanity	in	a	person,	it	takes	much	more	involvement.
It	means	giving	 _yourself_.

Morality	is	worthwhile	because	it	helps	ensure	social	order,	but	it	is	capable	of	wreaking
inner	 havoc.	 Since	 nobody	 can	 live	 by	 the	 morals	 prescribed	 by	 most	 religions,	 most	 of
humanity	 lives	 in	 a	 state	 of	 perpetual	 guilt,	 shame,	 and	 fear.	 This	 is	 a	 tragically	 crippled
existence.	 Humanity	 will	 also	 bring	 social	 order,	 but	 it	 requires	 no	 external	 enforcement
whatsoever.

Make	a	list	of	all	the	things	that	the	major	religions	of	the	world	call	a	“sin,”	and	you	will
find	that	just	to	be	alive	is	a	sin.	If	you	are	born	it	is	a	sin;	if	you	menstruate,	it	is	a	sin;	if	you
copulate,	it	is	a	sin.	Forget	all	this,	even	if	you	so	much	as	eat	a	chocolate,	you	could	commit
a	sin.	Since	the	very	process	of	life	is	a	sin,	you	live	in	perennial	guilt	and	terror.	If	people
were	not	so	wracked	by	fear	and	guilt,	the	temples,	mosques,	and	churches	in	the	world	would
not	be	as	congested	as	they	are	now.	If	you	were	naturally	joyful,	you	would	go	and	sit	on	the
beach,	or	listen	to	the	whisper	of	the	leaves	on	the	tree.	Only	because	religions	have	instilled
such	a	sense	of	fear	and	shame	are	you	ashamed	of	your	very	biology!	Now	you	have	to	go	to
someplace	that	is	considered	“holy”	to	wash	it	off.

People	 will	 always	 find	 ways	 to	 subvert	 values,	 morals,	 and	 ethics.	 But	 when	 you	 are
naturally	joyful,	you	are	naturally	pleasant	with	the	world	around	you.	Spirituality	does	not
mean	moving	away	from	life;	it	means	becoming	alive	to	the	core,	in	the	fullest	possible	way.
With	age,	physical	agility	may	diminish,	but	the	level	of	joy	and	aliveness	need	not.	If	your
level	of	joy	and	aliveness	is	declining,	you	are	committing	suicide	in	installments.

Unfortunately,	all	kinds	of	belief	systems	are	passed	off	as	spirituality	today.	The	spiritual
process	is	always	a	quest.	There	is	a	significant	difference	between	 _believing_ and	 _seeking_.
Believing	means	you	have	assumed	something	that	you	do	not	know;	seeking	means	you	have
realized	that	you	do	not	know.	This	brings	an	enormous	amount	of	flexibility.	The	moment
you	believe	something,	you	bring	a	certain	rigidity	into	the	very	life	process	that	you	are.
This	rigidity	is	not	just	in	attitude;	it	percolates	into	every	aspect	of	your	life	and	is	the	cause
of	an	enormous	amount	of	suffering	in	the	world.	Human	society	reflects	the	inner	experience
of	human	beings.	Creating	human	beings	who	are	flexible	and	willing	to	look	at	everything	in
a	fresh,	unprejudiced	way,	rather	than	being	stuck	in	beliefs	and	opinions,	definitely	makes
for	a	different	kind	of	society.


Yoga	is	a	method	that	has	worked	wonderfully	for	me,	and	for	millions	of	people.	It	is	an
entirely	scientific	method	that	originates	not	in	faith	or	belief	but	in	a	profound	understanding
of	the	human	mechanism.	Nor	does	it	come	from	some	naïve	sense	of	optimism.	The	premise
is	 simple:	 if	 you	 have	 a	 good	 seed	 and	 if	 you	 create	 the	 right	 atmosphere,	 it	 will	 sprout.
Creating	the	right	atmosphere	of	body	and	mind	is	the	only	work.	You	do	not	have	to	do
anything	 else.	 No	 teachings	 of	 morality,	 no	 metaphysical	 discourses	 are	 needed.	 If	 your
humanity	is	stirred,	you	are	a	beautiful	human	being.

All	that	is	considered	to	be	negative	in	the	world	actually	springs	from	limitation.	A	limited
identity	that	we	impose	upon	ourselves	is	what	sets	us	up	as	“me”	versus	the	“other.”	It	is	in
this	space	of	division	and	separation	that	all	crime	and	negativity	is	born.	So,	striving	for	the
infinite	 is	 an	 insurance	 against	 all	 negative	 tendencies.	 As	 a	 race,	 humanity	 now	 needs	 to
liberate	life,	rather	than	control	it.	From	limitation	to	liberation—this	is	the	way.


**The	Wishing	Tree**

Your	mind	can	be	in	five	different	states.	It	could	be	inert—meaning,	it	is	not	activated	at	all;	it
is	in	a	rudimentary	state.	If	you	energize	it,	it	becomes	active	but	scattered.	If	you	energize	it
further,	it	is	no	longer	scattered,	but	starts	oscillating.	If	you	energize	it	further,	it	becomes
one-pointed.	If	you	energize	it	still	further,	it	will	become	conscious.	And	if	your	mind	is
conscious,	it	is	magic;	it	is	a	miracle;	it	is	a	bridge	to	the	beyond.

Inert	minds	are	not	a	problem.	Someone	who	is	very	simpleminded	and	whose	intellect	is
still	not	effervescent	has	no	trouble.	He	eats	well	and	sleeps	well.	It	is	only	people	who	think
too	much	who	cannot	eat	and	sleep	properly!	Simpleminded	people	perform	all	the	activities
of	the	body	far	better	than	the	so-called	intellectuals	of	the	world.	There	is	a	certain	peace	in
them	because	you	need	some	intelligence	to	create	disturbance	and	chaos.	An	inert	mind	is
closer	to	animal	nature	than	the	human.

The	moment	you	pump	in	some	energy,	the	mind	becomes	active,	but	it	is	often	scattered.
When	 some	 people	 begin	 their	 spiritual	 practices,	 they	 may	 experience	 a	 new	 level	 of
effervescence	that	they	may	not	be	able	to	handle,	unless	they	are	in	congenial	atmospheres.
They	may	interpret	this	mental	effervescence,	powered	by	new	energy	levels	in	the	system,	as
disturbance.	There	is	a	pervasive	paranoia	among	people,	a	tendency	to	fear	everything	that	is
new.	 But	 in	 reality,	 all	 they	 are	 doing	 is	 moving	 from	 inertness	 toward	 a	 higher	 level	 of
aliveness.

Once	those	who	have	very	scattered	minds	start	spiritual	practices,	they	reach	a	place	where
the	 mind	 becomes	 less	 diffuse.	 But	 now	 it	 starts	 oscillating—one	 day,	 it	 moves	 this	 way;
another	day,	the	other	way.	This	is,	however,	a	huge	improvement	over	being	scattered,	where
the	mind	moves	every	moment	across	ten	different	places.

If	 the	 mind	 was	 already	 oscillating	 and	 is	 energized	 further,	 then	 slowly	 it	 becomes
concentrated,	or,	as	we	say	in	yoga,	“one-pointed.”	That	is	far	better	than	the	previous	state.
But	the	highest	state	is	when	the	mind	becomes	 _conscious._ 	In	terms	of	instruments,	it	is	not
your	computer,	car,	or	spacecraft,	but	the	human	mind	that	is	the	most	miraculous—if	only
you	could	use	it	consciously.	The	reason	why	success	comes	so	easily	and	naturally	for	one
person,	and	is	a	struggle	for	someone	else,	is	essentially	this:	one	person	has	organized	his	or
her	mind	to	think	the	way	he	wants,	and	another	thinks	against	his	or	her	own	interests.

A	 well-established	 human	 mind	 is	 referred	 to	 as	 a	 _kalpavriksha,_ or	 a	 wishing	 tree	 that
grants	any	boon.	With	such	a	mind,	whatever	you	ask	for	becomes	a	reality.	All	you	need	to
do	is	to	develop	the	mind	to	a	point	where	it	becomes	a	wishing	tree,	rather	than	a	source	of
madness.	A	mind	that	can	manifest	whatever	it	chooses	is	described	in	yoga	as	being	in	a	state
of	 _samyukti_ .	This	is	a	skillfulness	that	arises	out	of	equanimity.

```
Once	your	thoughts	get	organized,	your	emotions	will	also	get	organized.	Gradually,	your
```

energies	and	body	get	organized	in	the	same	direction	as	well.	However,	the	order	in	which
you	address	these	dimensions	could	vary,	depending	on	what	you	are	ready	for.	Considering
the	 realities	 of	 the	 day,	 most	 people	 are	 not	 ready	 for	 any	 system	 unless	 they	 are	 first
intellectually	convinced	of	it.	Eventually,	once	your	thoughts,	emotions,	body,	and	energy	are
channeled	in	one	direction,	your	ability	to	create	and	manifest	what	you	want	is	incredible.

Today	modern	science	is	proving	that	this	whole	existence	is	just	a	reverberation	of	energy,
an	endless	vibration.	Thoughts	too	are	a	reverberation.	If	you	generate	a	powerful	thought
and	let	it	out,	it	will	always	manifest	itself.	For	this	to	happen,	it	is	important	that	you	do	not
impede	and	weaken	your	thought	by	creating	negative	and	self-defeating	thought	patterns.

Generally,	people	use	faith	as	a	means	to	banish	negative	thoughts.	Once	you	become	a
thinking	human	being,	however,	doubts	invariably	surface.	The	way	your	mind	is	made,	if
God	appears	right	here	this	moment,	you	will	not	surrender	to	him	or	her.	Instead,	you	will
want	to	conduct	an	investigation	to	find	out	whether	this	is	the	genuine	article	or	not.

There	is	an	alternative	to	faith,	which	is	 _commitment_ .	If	you	simply	commit	yourself	to
creating	what	you	really	care	for,	now	once	again	your	thoughts	get	organized	in	such	a	way
that	 there	 are	 no	 hurdles.	 Your	 thoughts	 flow	 freely	 toward	 what	 you	 want,	 and	 once	 this
happens,	the	manifestation	of	your	desire	is	a	natural	consequence.

To	create	what	you	really	care	for,	your	desire	must	first	be	well	manifested	in	your	mind.
Is	that	what	you	 _really_ 	want?	Think	this	through	carefully.	How	many	times	in	your	life	have
you	thought,	“This	is	it.”	The	moment	you	got	there	you	realized	that	was	not	it	at	all!	So,	first
explore	what	it	is	that	you	really	want.	Once	that	is	clear	and	you	are	committed	to	creating	it,
you	generate	a	continuous	process	of	thought	in	that	direction.	When	you	maintain	a	steady
stream	of	thought	without	changing	direction,	it	will	manifest	as	a	reality	in	your	life.

There	 are	 yogic	 processes	 by	 which	 you	 can	 touch	 another	 dimension	 of	 intelligence,
unsullied	by	memory,	called	chitta,	which	we	have	mentioned	earlier.	Realizing	the	power	of
chitta	is	called	 _chit	shakti,_ 	a	simple	and	powerful	process	through	which	you	can	access	the
very	source	of	creation	within	you.


**The	Myth	of	Head	versus	Heart**

It	is	common	to	hear	people	say	that	their	head	leads	them	in	one	direction	and	their	heart	in
another.	In	yoga,	the	fundamental	basis	we	establish	is	this:	you	are	one	person,	a	single,
unified	being.	There	is	no	separation	of	head	and	heart;	you	are	one	whole.

Let	us	first	understand	what	is	being	referred	to	as	the	“head”	and	the	“heart.”	You	usually
assign	 your	 thoughts	 to	 the	 head	 and	 your	 emotions	 to	 the	 heart.	 But	 if	 you	 look	 at	 this
carefully	and	with	absolute	sincerity,	you	will	realize	that	the	way	you	think	is	the	way	you
feel.	But	it	is	also	true	that	the	way	you	feel	is	the	way	you	think.	This	is	why	yoga	includes
both	thought	and	emotion	as	part	of	the	same	 _manomayakosha,_ 	or	mental	body.

What	you	normally	think	of	as	“mind”	is	the	thought	process	or	intellect.	But	in	fact,	the
mind	has	many	dimensions:	one	is	the	logical	aspect;	another	is	the	deeper	emotional	aspect.
The	 intellect,	 as	 we	 know,	 is	 termed	 buddhi.	 The	 deeper	 dimension	 of	 the	 mind	 is
conventionally	 known	 as	 the	 heart.	 But	 in	 yoga	 this	 deeper	 emotional	 mind	 is	 known	 as
manas.	Manas	is	a	complex	amalgam	of	memory	that	molds	emotions	in	a	particular	way.	So,
the	way	you	feel	and	the	way	you	think	are	both	activities	of	the	mind.

It	is	quite	simple.	If	I	think	you	are	a	wonderful	person,	I	will	have	sweet	emotions	toward
you.	If	I	think	you	are	a	horrible	person,	I	will	harbor	nasty	emotions	about	you.	If	you	make
someone	your	enemy	and	then	try	to	love	him	or	her,	that	is	hard	work.	Let	us	not	make	hard
work	of	the	simple	aspects	of	life.

The	way	you	think	is	the	way	you	feel,	but	thought	and	feeling	seem	to	be	different	in	your
experience.	Why	is	this	so?	Because	thought	has	a	certain	clarity,	a	certain	agility	about	it.
Emotion	is	slower.	Today,	you	think	this	is	a	very	wonderful	person	and	you	have	warm
feelings	 about	 him.	 Suddenly,	 he	 does	 something	 that	 you	 don’t	 like,	 and	 you	 think	 he	 is
horrible.	Your	thought	tells	you	he	is	horrible,	but	your	emotion	cannot	change	immediately.
It	struggles.	If	it	is	sweet	now,	it	cannot	turn	bitter	at	the	very	next	moment.	It	takes	time	to	turn
around.	It	has	a	wider	turning	arc.	Depending	on	the	strength	of	your	emotion,	maybe	it	will
take	three	days	or	three	months	or	three	years,	but	after	some	time,	it	will	turn	around.

It	is	not	useful	to	create	this	conflict	between	head	and	heart.	Emotion	is	just	the	juicier	part
of	thought.	You	can	enjoy	its	sweetness,	but	it	is	largely	the	thought	that	leads	the	emotion,
whether	you	recognize	it	or	not.	Emotion	is	not	entirely	steady.	Your	emotion	also	chatters,
goes	this	way	and	that,	but	it	is	less	agile	than	thought.	Since	it	takes	longer	to	turn,	and	its
intensity	is	usually	substantially	greater	than	thought,	it	often	seems	as	though	thought	and
emotion	are	different.	But	they	are	no	more	separate	than	sugarcane	and	its	juice.

Thought	is	not	as	intense	as	emotion	in	most	people’s	experience.	(You	usually	do	not	think
as	intensely	as	you	get	angry,	for	instance.)	But	if	you	generate	an	intense	enough	thought,	it
can	 also	 overwhelm	 you.	 Only	 five	 to	 ten	 percent	 of	 the	 population	 may	 be	 capable	 of


generating	the	kind	of	thought	that	is	so	intense	that	there	is	no	need	for	emotion.	Ninety
percent	of	the	population	can	only	generate	intense	emotions	because	they	have	never	done
the	necessary	work	in	the	other	direction.	But	there	are	people	whose	thought	is	very	deep.
They	don’t	have	much	emotion,	but	they	are	very	deep	thinkers.

It	 is	 best	 not	 to	 create	 polarities	 within	 yourself.	 That	 makes	 for	 civil	 war	 and
schizophrenia.	Thought	and	feeling	are	not	different.	One	is	dry.	Another	is	juicy.	Enjoy	both.


**Knowing	and	Devotion**

In	the	yogic	culture,	there	are	two	aspects	to	the	word	 _shi-va_ .	The	word	literally	means	“that
which	is	not.”	Everything	that	 _is_ 	has	come	from	“that	which	is	not.”	If	you	look	up	at	the	sky,
you	will	see	many	stars	and	celestial	objects,	but	still	the	biggest	presence	out	there	is	a	vast
emptiness.	It	is	in	the	lap	of	this	no-thingness	that	the	dance	of	creation	is	happening	right
now.	This	emptiness,	which	is	the	very	basis	of	creation,	is	referred	to	as	“shi-va.”

Another	 dimension	 of	 Shiva	 is	 Adiyogi,	 the	 first	 yogi,	 who	 opened	 up	 the	 incredible
science	of	yoga	for	humanity.	The	yogic	culture	moves	seamlessly	from	invoking	shi-va	as
the	basis	of	creation	to	invoking	Shiva	as	the	first	yogi.	Thus	shi-va	becomes	personified	as
Shiva.

Is	this	contradictory?
Not	 at	 all.	 Because	 once	 yoga	 or	 ultimate	 union	 has	 happened,	 there	 is	 no	 longer	 a
distinction	between	ultimate	reality	and	the	one	who	has	experienced	it.	In	accordance	with
this	logic,	the	yogic	culture	offers	two	ways	to	reach	the	ultimate	state:	becoming	everything
or	becoming	nothing;	the	path	of	 _gnana,_ 	knowing,	or	the	path	of	 _bhakti,_ 	devotion.

If	you	want	to	experience	shi-va,	or	the	dimension	beyond	the	physical,	you	either	come	to
terms	with	the	laws	that	govern	the	non-physical	realm	or	you	dissolve	into	this	dimension,
because	 it	 spells	 freedom	 from	 the	 laws	 that	 govern	 the	 physical	 realm.	 If	 you	 want	 to
experience	 a	 mountain	 peak,	 you	 either	 elevate	 yourself	 to	 that	 level,	 or	 simply	 look	 up.
These	are	the	two	fundamental	ways.	Otherwise,	no	meeting	is	possible.	Through	knowledge,
you	aspire	to	meet	“that	which	is	not”	face-to-face.	Through	devotion,	you	strive	to	obliterate
your	 limited	 and	 rigid	 persona	 and	 move	 toward	 a	 more	 flexible	 state	 from	 which	 you
approach	the	dimension	beyond	the	framework	of	your	likes	and	dislikes.	These	likes	and
dislikes	 are	 the	 very	 basis	 of	 your	 persona.	 The	 endless	 nature	 of	 human	 desire	 is	 an
expression	of	longing	for	infinite	nature	or	life	beyond	physical	existence.	Infinity	and	zero
are	just	positive	and	negative	expressions	of	the	same	reality.

Devotion	 means	 dropping	 the	 dualities	 of	 like	 and	 dislike,	 attachment	 and	 aversion.	 It
means	“what’s	fine”	and	“what’s	not	fine”	do	not	exist	for	you	anymore;	 _everything_ 	is	fine.
When	a	devotee	says	“God	is	everywhere”	or	“everything	is	God,”	he	is	essentially	saying
“everything	is	fine.”	By	believing	that	God	is	everywhere,	he	or	she	arrives	at	a	deep	state	of
acceptance	that	is	transformative	and	liberating.	Bhakti	is	all-encompassing	and	all-inclusive;
it	does	not	discriminate.	This	is	the	nature	of	the	ultimate	reality	as	well.

Since	ancient	times,	devotion	has	been	seen	as	the	most	important	spiritual	path,	because	it
is	the	quickest.	But	it	has	its	own	pitfalls.	The	path	of	knowing	is	harder,	but	it	is	an	“eyes-
open”	path.	Devotion,	on	the	other	hand,	is	an	“eyes-closed”	path.	With	knowing,	every	step
you	take,	forward	or	backward,	you	know	where	you	are	going.	With	devotion,	whether	you


are	moving	toward	your	liberation	or	you	have	fallen	into	a	pit,	you	have	no	clue.

Generally,	for	most	people,	emotion	is	more	intense	than	thought.	That	is	why	devotion	has
been	glorified	above	all	other	paths.	But	without	the	right	understanding	and	wisdom,	walking
the	path	of	devotion	can	lead	to	all	kinds	of	delusions.	Devotion	is	a	tool	to	transcend	the	dual
nature	of	logic.	But	instead	of	transcending	logic,	one	may	end	up	denying	logic	altogether.
So,	 standing	 on	 a	 stable	 platform	 of	 logic	 before	 going	 into	 the	 fluid	 state	 of	 devotion
becomes	important.

Conversely,	many	people	believe	that	devotion	has	no	place	in	the	logical	realm.	But	this	is
not	true.	Logic	is	essentially	a	cutting	tool,	an	instrument	of	discernment.	If	your	logic	is	like
a	machete,	when	you	consider	something,	it	will	fall	into	two	pieces.	But	if	the	scalpel	of
logic	you	employ	is	very	finely	honed,	you	can	cut	through	something,	and	still	seem	to	leave
it	in	one	piece.	When	a	fine	swordsman	uses	his	sword	to	cut	a	tree,	it	is	said	even	the	tree
should	not	know;	it	should	still	stand	as	one.	If	your	intellect	becomes	this	refined,	you	will
find	devotion	fits	in	perfectly	with	your	logic.

Devotion	can	be	very	beautiful,	joyous,	ecstatic,	but	without	the	clarity	of	knowing,	it	could
lead	to	stagnation.	On	the	other	hand,	without	emotion,	spiritual	practices	can	become	barren,
dry,	and	lifeless.	Without	bhakti,	gnana	becomes	simply	a	hairsplitting	exercise.

As	I	said	earlier,	if	you	want	to	experience	a	mountain	peak,	you	either	elevate	yourself	to
that	level,	or	simply	look	up.	The	devotee	knows	that	if	you	manage	to	ascend	to	meet	the
peak,	you	still	only	stand	 _beside_ 	the	peak.	But	if	you	become	the	valley,	you	hold	the	entire
mountain	in	your	lap.


```
YOGA	AND	INTOXICATION
```
According	to	legend,	Adiyogi	drank	 _somarasa,_ 	the	intoxicating	juice	of	the
moon.	 He	 simply	 imbibed	 the	 distilled	 essence	 of	 the	 moonbeams	 and	 was
described	as	constantly	drunk.

Yogis	 are	 not	 against	 pleasure.	 They	 are	 unwilling	 to	 settle	 for	 little
pleasures,	that’s	all!	They	know	if	you	drink	a	glass	of	wine,	it	just	gives	you	a
buzz,	but	tomorrow	morning	it	gives	you	a	headache	and	more.	Yogis	are	not
willing	to	settle	for	that.	To	enjoy	intoxication	you	must	be	totally	drunk	yet
fully	alert.	I	have	never	touched	any	substance,	but	if	you	look	into	my	eyes
you	will	see	that	I	am	always	stoned.	I	am	totally	drunk	and	fully	aware.	This	is
one	of	the	pleasures	that	the	science	of	yoga	offers.

The	end	goal	is	not	just	intoxication.	This	blissful	state	eliminates	the	fear
of	suffering.	In	this	state	of	nameless	ecstasy,	there	are	no	concerns	about	self-
preservation.	This	is	what	makes	a	human	being	capable	of	being	and	acting	in
a	way	that	can	sometimes	seem	superhuman	to	others.

Only	 when	 the	 gnawing	 anxiety	 of	 self-preservation	 is	 completely
eliminated	 from	 your	 mind	 would	 you	 dare	 to	 explore	 life.	 Otherwise	 you
only	want	to	protect	it.	Once	the	fear	of	suffering	is	dropped,	you	can	plunge
into	any	situation	without	hesitation.	Even	if	you	are	damned	to	eternal	hell,
you	will	happily	go	there	because	you	have	no	fear	of	suffering!

When	everybody	was	talking	about	going	to	heaven,	Gautama	the	Buddha
said,	“You	say	everything	is	fine	in	heaven,	so	what	will	I	do	there?	Let	me	go
to	hell	and	do	something	to	help	others,	because	anyway	I	cannot	suffer.”

As	long	as	the	fear	of	suffering	persists,	you	will	not	dare	to	explore	the
deeper	dimensions	of	life.	Only	this	body	needs	to	be	protected;	nothing	else
within	you	needs	protection.	If	you	are	willing	to	drop	the	ideas,	philosophies,
and	belief	systems	you	are	currently	attached	to,	you	can	re-create	your	entire
life	with	the	very	next	moment.


**Love	Mantra**

And	what	about	love?	Is	there	such	a	thing	as	unconditional	love?	Can	it	truly	exist	between
two	human	beings?	These	are	frequently	asked	questions.

One	day	Shankaran	Pillai	went	to	a	park.	He	saw	an	attractive	woman	seated	on	a	stone
bench.	He	settled	down	on	the	same	bench.	After	a	few	minutes	he	moved	a	little	closer.	She
moved	away.	He	waited	for	a	few	minutes,	then	moved	a	little	closer;	she	moved	away.	When
he	did	this	again,	she	moved	to	the	very	end	of	the	bench.	He	went	very	close	and	put	his	arm
around	her.	She	shoved	him	away.	Then	he	went	down	on	his	knees,	plucked	a	flower,	handed
it	to	her,	and	said,	“I	love	you	like	I	have	never	loved	anybody	in	my	life.”

The	sun	was	setting.	He	had	a	flower	in	his	hand.	He	looked	at	her	with	a	melting	gaze.
Above	all,	the	ambience	was	right.	She	thawed.	Nature	took	over	and	they	had	their	way	with
each	other.	The	dusk	deepened	into	night.	Shankaran	Pillai	suddenly	sprang	to	his	feet	and
said,	“It’s	eight	o’clock.	I	need	to	go.”

She	said,	“What?	Now?	You	just	said	you	loved	me	more	than	anyone	else!”
“Yes,	yes,	of	course,	but	my	wife	will	be	waiting.”
Generally,	 we	 have	 made	 relationships	 within	 frameworks	 that	 are	 comfortable	 and
profitable	for	us.	People	have	physical,	psychological,	emotional,	financial,	and	social	needs
to	fulfill.	To	fulfill	these	needs,	one	of	the	best	ways	is	to	tell	someone,	“I	love	you.”	This	so-
called	love	has	become	something	of	an	“open	sesame”	mantra.	You	can	get	what	you	want	by
saying	it.

Love	is	a	quality,	not	something	to	do	with	somebody	else.	Every	action	that	we	do	is	in
some	way	to	fulfill	certain	needs.	If	you	see	this,	then	there	is	a	possibility	that	you	can	grow
into	love	as	your	natural	quality.	But	you	can	go	on	fooling	yourself	into	believing	that	the
relationships	 you	 have	 made	 for	 convenience,	 comfort,	 and	 well-being	 are	 actually
relationships	 of	 love.	 I	 am	 not	 saying	 there	 is	 no	 experience	 of	 love	 at	 all	 in	 these
associations,	but	it	is	within	certain	limitations.	It	does	not	matter	how	many	times	true	love
has	been	proclaimed;	if	a	few	expectations	and	requirements	are	not	fulfilled,	things	fall	apart.
This	is	essentially	a	mutual	benefit	scheme.

There	 is	 really	 no	 such	 thing	 as	 conditional	 love	 and	 unconditional	 love.	 There	 are
conditions	 and	 there	 is	 love.	 When	 you	 talk	 about	 love,	 it	 _has_ to	 be	 unconditional.	 The
moment	there	is	a	condition,	it	just	amounts	to	a	transaction.	Maybe	a	convenient	transaction,
maybe	 a	 good	 arrangement,	 but	 that	 will	 not	 fulfill	 you	 or	 transport	 you	 to	 another
dimension.	It	is	just	convenient.	Love	need	not	necessarily	be	convenient;	most	of	the	time	it	is
not.	It	takes	 _life_ .	You	have	to	invest	 _yourself_.


If	you	have	to	be	in	love,	you	should	not	 _be_ .	The	English	expression	“falling	in	love”	is
very	significant.	You	don’t	climb	in	love,	you	don’t	stand	in	love,	you	don’t	fly	in	love,	you
_fall_ 	in	love.	Something	of	you	should	fall	or	melt	away	to	accommodate	the	other.	There	is	a
distinction	 between	 a	 transaction	 and	 a	 love	 affair.	 A	 love	 affair	 need	 not	 be	 with	 any
particular	person;	you	could	be	having	a	great	love	affair	with	life	itself.

What	you	do	or	do	not	do	is	in	accordance	with	the	circumstances	you	are	in.	Our	actions
are	always	molded	by	the	demands	of	external	situations.	But	love	is	an	inner	state,	and	how
you	are	within	yourself	can	definitely	be	unconditional.	Acts	of	love	can	become	tedious	and
stressful	over	a	period	of	time.	You	realize	love	is	not	something	that	you	do;	love	is	the	way
you	are.

Sadhana

```
Love	is	never	between	two	people.	It	is	what	happens	within	you,	and	your	interiority	need	not	be	enslaved
to	someone	or	something	else.	Try	this	for	fifteen	minutes	or	so:	go	sit	with	something	that	means	nothing	to
you	right	now—maybe	a	tree,	a	pebble,	a	worm,	or	an	insect.	Do	it	a	few	days	in	a	row.	After	a	while,	you
will	find	you	can	look	upon	it	with	as	much	love	as	you	do	your	wife	or	husband	or	mother	or	child.
Maybe	the	worm	does	not	know	this.	That	doesn’t	matter.	If	you	can	look	at	everything	lovingly,	the
whole	world	becomes	beautiful	in	your	experience.
```

**Devotion:	A	Dimensional	Shift**

Most	people	live	cautiously,	measuring	out	their	love	and	joy	in	sparing	doses	for	fear	that	it
will	run	out.	The	most	generous	way	to	live	is	to	set	an	example	to	the	rest	of	the	world	by
living	life	full-throttle	and	beyond	all	limitations.	If	you	are	so	stingy	that	you	cannot	love,
laugh,	 or	 live	 totally,	 you	 are	 what	 we	 in	 India	 term	 a	 _kanjoos—_ a	 miser—on	 all	 levels!
Devotion	means	you	are	not	a	kanjoos—you	are	full	of	juice!	A	devotee	is	someone	who
seeks	to	explore	and	experience	life	as	fully	as	possible.

Devotion	is	not	a	dissection	of	life,	but	a	total	embrace.	It	is	not	a	love	affair,	but	a	crazy
business.	Love	itself	is	crazy,	but	there	are	shreds	of	sanity	attached	to	it;	you	can	still	recover.
In	devotion,	there	is	no	shred	of	sanity;	there	is	no	way	to	recover.	Devotees	have	the	sweetest
experience	of	life.	Everybody	may	think	they	are	idiots,	but	they	are	having	the	best	time	on
the	planet.	You	decide	who	the	idiot	is!

When	I	say	“devotion,”	I	am	not	talking	about	faith	or	belief.	Belief	is	just	like	morality.
People	who	believe	something	often	think	they	are	superior	to	others.	All	that	happens	the
moment	you	believe	something	is	that	your	stupidity	acquires	confidence.	Confidence	and
stupidity	 are	 a	 very	 dangerous	 combination,	 but	 they	 generally	 go	 together.	 If	 you	 start
looking	at	the	world	around	you,	you	would	clearly	understand	that	what	you	know	is	so
minuscule	 that	 there	 is	 no	 way	 to	 act	 with	 confidence.	 A	 belief	 system	 takes	 away	 this
problem;	it	gives	you	enormous	confidence,	but	it	does	not	cure	your	stupidity.

Devotion	is	not	an	act;	it	is	not	directed	toward	one	thing	or	another;	the	 _object_ 	of	devotion
is	immaterial.	It	is	just	that	with	devotion	you	have	dissolved	all	the	resistance	in	you	so	that
the	divine	can	transpire	as	effortlessly	as	breath.	The	divine	is	not	an	entity	sitting	up	there;	it
is	a	living	force	every	moment	of	your	life.	Devotion	makes	you	aware	of	this.

Once	it	happened...At	a	traditional	Catholic	family	dinner,	the	man	of	the	house	came	to	the
table,	looked	at	the	food,	and,	as	usual,	grumbled	and	cursed	his	wife	and	everything	around
him.	 After	 the	 cursing	 was	 over	 and	 everyone	 settled	 down,	 he	 sat	 down	 and	 uttered	 his
prayer,	“Dear	God,	thank	you	for	the	daily	bread	and	all	the	wonderful	things	on	the	table.”

His	 five-year-old	 girl	 sat	 meekly	 at	 the	 table.	 You	 know,	 these	 five-year-olds—extra
pillows	and	little	cushions	are	always	kept	for	them,	but	still	they	can	never	really	reach	the
plate.	So,	this	little	five-year-old	girl,	with	the	table	up	to	her	neck,	squeaked,	“Daddy,	does
God	hear	all	our	prayers?”

Immediately,	the	Christian	in	him	awakened	and	he	said,	“Yes,	of	course.	Every	prayer	we
utter,	He	always	hears.”

Then	the	girl	sank	a	little	lower,	because	she	sank	into	her	thoughts.	After	a	while,	she	said,
“But,	Daddy,	does	He	also	listen	to	all	the	other	things	that	we	say?”

```
“Yes,	every	moment	of	our	lives	God	is	listening	to	everything	that	we	say	and	do.”
```

Then	she	sank	a	little	lower	and	said,	“Daddy,	then	which	does	He	believe?”
Tell	me,	which	should	God	believe—your	prayers	or	your	curses?	He	must	be	thoroughly
confused!	He	must	have	given	up.	Because	we	systematize	or	institutionalize	the	most	subtle
parts	of	life,	suddenly	everything	loses	its	vibrancy	and	becomes	lifeless.	The	same	words	are
being	uttered,	parrot-like,	by	everybody,	but	they	do	not	mean	anything	anymore.	When	we
say	something	that	does	not	really	mean	anything	to	us,	that	does	not	burn	within	us,	it	is
tantamount	to	a	lie.	It	is	actually	better	to	shut	up.

We	 are	 always	 trying	 to	 mimic	 those	 whom	 we	 consider	 to	 be	 our	 mentors	 and	 role
models.	When	somebody	said	something	similar	two	thousand	years	ago	it	worked	for	him—
because	of	the	fire	in	his	heart,	because	of	the	truth	that	was	burning	within	him,	not	because
of	the	words	he	uttered.

There	 is	 nothing	 tame	 or	 tepid	 about	 devotion.	 It	 is	 not	 for	 the	 lily-livered.	 It	 is	 hot.
Devotion	scorches.


```
AKKA	MAHADEVI
```
Around	nine	hundred	years	ago	in	southern	India,	there	lived	a	female	mystic
called	Akka	Mahadevi.	Akka	was	a	devotee	of	Shiva.	Ever	since	her	childhood,
she	had	regarded	Shiva	as	her	beloved,	her	husband.	It	was	not	just	a	belief;
for	her	it	was	a	living	reality.

The	king	saw	this	beautiful	young	woman	one	day,	and	decided	he	wanted
her	 as	 his	 wife.	 She	 refused.	 But	 the	 king	 was	 adamant	 and	 threatened	 her
parents,	so	she	yielded.

She	married	the	man,	but	she	kept	him	at	a	physical	distance.	He	tried	to
woo	her,	but	her	constant	refrain	was,	“Shiva	is	my	husband.”	Time	passed	and
the	king’s	patience	wore	thin.	Infuriated,	he	tried	to	lay	his	hands	upon	her.	She
refused.	“I	have	another	husband.	His	name	is	Shiva.	He	visits	me,	and	I	am
with	him.	I	cannot	be	with	you.”

Because	she	claimed	to	have	another	husband,	she	was	brought	to	court	for
prosecution.	Akka	is	said	to	have	announced	to	all	present,	“Being	a	queen
doesn’t	mean	a	thing	to	me.	I	will	leave.”

When	 the	 king	 saw	 the	 ease	 with	 which	 she	 was	 walking	 away	 from
everything,	 he	 made	 a	 last	 futile	 effort	 to	 salvage	 his	 dignity.	 He	 said,
“Everything	 on	 your	 person—your	 jewels,	 your	 garments—belongs	 to	 me.
Leave	it	all	here	and	go.”

So,	in	the	full	assembly,	Akka	just	dropped	her	jewelry,	all	her	clothes,	and
walked	away	naked.	From	that	day	on,	she	refused	to	wear	clothes	even	though
many	tried	to	convince	her	otherwise.	It	was	unbelievable	for	a	woman	to	be
walking	 naked	 on	 the	 streets	 of	 India	 at	 the	 time—and	 this	 was	 a	 beautiful
young	woman.	She	lived	out	her	life	as	a	wandering	mendicant	and	composed
some	exquisite	poetry	that	lives	on	to	this	very	day.

```
In	a	poem	(translated	by	A.	K.	Ramanujan),	she	says:
```
```
People,
male	and	female,
blush	when	a	cloth	covering	their	shame
comes	loose.
When	the	lord	of	lives
lives	drowned	without	a	face
```

```
in	the	world,	how	can	you	be	modest?
```
```
When	all	the	world	is	the	eye	of	the	lord,
onlooking	everywhere,	what	can	you
cover	and	conceal?
```
Devotees	of	this	kind	may	be	in	this	world	but	not	of	it.	The	power	and
passion	 with	 which	 they	 lived	 their	 lives	 make	 them	 inspirations	 for
generations	of	humanity.	Akka	continues	to	be	a	living	presence	in	the	Indian
collective	 consciousness,	 and	 her	 lyrical	 poems	 remain	 among	 the	 most
prized	works	of	South	Indian	literature	to	this	very	day.


**Embracing	Mystery**

It	 is	 only	 a	 juvenile	 intelligence	 that	 analyzes	 things	 and	 arrives	 at	 a	 conclusion.	 If	 your
intelligence	is	sufficiently	evolved	and	mature,	you	realize	that	the	more	you	analyze,	the
further	away	you	are	from	any	conclusion.

If	you	go	deeply	into	any	aspect	of	life,	you	will	move	further	and	further	away	from	any
conclusion.	Life	becomes	more	mysterious	than	ever	before.	The	more	you	delve	into	life,
you	see	that	it	is	an	endless	and	unfathomable	process.	You	cannot	get	it	because	you	are	it.
When	you	realize	experientially	that	every	atom,	every	grain	of	sand,	every	pebble,	every
piece	of	life	from	the	smallest	to	the	biggest	is	unfathomable,	you	will	naturally	bow	down	in
utmost	devotion	to	everything.	If	you	simply	sit	here	and	breathe,	you	will	know	life	better
than	through	any	deep	analysis.

As	we	dissect	everything,	wanting	to	excavate	truth	from	physical	nature,	we	enter	into	the
minute	dimensions	of	particle	science.	From	protons,	neutrons,	and	electrons	to	neutrinos,
bosons,	and	super-symmetric	particles,	we	seem	to	be	going	deeper	and	deeper.	But	all	this	is
still	only	in	the	realm	of	physical	nature.	Dark	matter,	we	are	told,	comprises	more	of	the
universe	than	matter—and	this	dark	matter	is	not	composed	of	atoms	at	all	but	of	particles	of
a	still	unknown	type.

Pick	up	a	glass	of	water	and	take	a	look	at	it.	What	do	you	really	know	about	it?	Why,	for
instance,	do	hydrogen	and	oxygen	combine	to	become	water?	Or	pick	up	a	pebble	and	gaze	at
it	long	and	hard.	Why	does	it	have	this	particular	shape,	size,	grain,	texture?	Or	just	look	at
yourself:	why	are	you	the	way	you	are?	Many	would	reply,	“Oh,	my	father,	my	mother—and
here	 I	 am.”	 But	 why	 are	 you	 like	 this?	 What	 is	 the	 basis	 of	 this	 form,	 this	 body,	 this
individuality?

Traditionally	 in	 India,	 it	 was	 said	 that	 one	 ought	 to	 bow	 down	 to	 everything	 that	 one
encountered.	It	did	not	matter	if	it	was	a	tree	or	a	cow	or	a	snake	or	a	cloud—you	just	bowed
down	to	it.	When	you	bow	to	everything,	it	could	be	because	you	are	a	fool,	or	because	you
have	 looked	 at	 life	 in	 its	 utmost	 profundity.	 The	 difference	 between	 an	 idiot	 and	 an
enlightened	being	is	thin.	The	two	often	look	similar,	but	they	are	actually	worlds	apart.	An
idiot	is	incapable	of	drawing	conclusions.	A	mystic	is	unwilling	to	draw	conclusions.	The	rest
have	glorified	their	conclusions	as	knowledge.	The	fool	just	enjoys	whatever	little	he	knows
and	one	who	has	seen	life	in	its	utmost	depth	enjoys	it	absolutely.	The	rest	are	the	ones	who
constantly	struggle	and	suffer.

One	morning	a	man	walked	into	his	office	and	told	his	boss,	“Boss,	I	want	you	to	know,
three	big	companies	are	after	me.	You	must	give	me	a	raise.”

```
His	boss	said,	“What!	Which	companies?	Who	wants	you?”
```

He	said,	“The	electric	company,	the	telephone	company,	and	the	gas	company.”
Something	is	always	behind	the	so-called	smart	people,	those	with	confirmed	conclusions
about	life!	Or	else,	they	are	always	busy	chasing	something.	An	idiot	can	sit	here	quietly.	A
mystic	can	sit	here	quietly.	The	rest	cannot.

Devotion	is	a	simple	method	of	dissolving	all	the	hurdles	on	the	path.	If	those	who	are
struggling	to	contain	the	chattering	of	the	“monkey	mind”	become	devoted,	the	chatter	will
just	evaporate.

If	you	learn	to	bow,	to	hold	everything	higher	than	yourself,	it	does	not	seem	to	be	good
for	your	self-esteem.	But	becoming	a	devotee	does	not	mean	you	are	a	pushover.	That	which
knows	how	to	bend	will	not	break.	(That	is	why	you	are	encouraged	to	do	your	hatha	yoga
every	morning—essentially	so	your	body	does	not	break!)	That	is	so	with	everything	within
you.

Unfortunately,	 these	 days	 even	 so-called	 spiritual	 leaders	 are	 talking	 about	 self-esteem.
“Self”	and	“esteem”	are	both	a	problem.	Both	are	very	limited	entities;	both	are	fragile;	both
will	always	be	insecure.	If	you	have	no	esteem,	very	good.	If	you	have	no	self,	fabulous!

Sadhana

```
When	you	experience	something	as	far	bigger	than	yourself,	bowing	down	will	naturally	occur	to	you.	If
you	want	to	become	a	devotee,	at	least	once	an	hour	in	all	the	waking	moments	of	your	life,	put	your
hands	together	and	bow	to	something.	It	does	not	matter	who	or	what.	Don’t	choose.	Whatever	you	see,
just	bow	your	head—whether	it	is	a	tree,	a	mountain,	a	dog,	a	cat,	or	anything.	This	need	not	be	a	physical
act;	it	could	be	internal	action.	Just	do	it	throughout	the	day,	once	an	hour.	See	if	it	can	become	once	a
minute.	When	it	becomes	once	a	minute,	there	is	no	need	to	use	your	hands	and	body;	simply	do	it	within
yourself.	Once	that	becomes	your	way	of	being,	you	are	a	devotee.
Even	if	you	spend	a	lifetime,	you	still	won’t	understand	a	leaf,	an	elephant,	an	ant,	or	an	atom.	You	are
incapable	of	figuring	out	even	a	molecule	of	DNA.	Everything	you	cannot	grasp	is	in	a	higher	state	of
existential	intelligence	than	you	are.	When	you	see	this—really	see	this—you	are	a	devotee.
A	devotee	is	someone	who	is	willing	to	dissolve	into	the	object	of	devotion.	If	you	are	a	devotee	of	life,
you	will	become	one	with	it.	Don’t	be	an	outsider	to	the	life	process.	Become	a	devotee.	Dissolve.

**Following	the	Pranic	Trail**

At	 present,	 human	 beings	 identify	 with	 the	 body	 and	 the	 mind	 in	 a	 variety	 of	 ways.	 But
fundamentally,	what	you	call	“myself”	is	just	a	certain	amount	of	energy.	Modern	science	has
proved	beyond	all	doubt	that	all	of	existence	is	made	up	of	the	same	energy,	manifesting	itself
in	millions	of	bewilderingly	different	ways.	When	Einstein	gives	us	the	formula	E	=	mc^2 ,	he
is,	to	put	it	simply,	saying	that	everything	in	the	universe	can	be	seen	as	just	one	energy.
Religions	all	over	the	world	have	been	proclaiming	the	same	thing	using	somewhat	different
terminology	when	they	assert	that	“God	is	everywhere.”

Modern	science	has	arrived	at	its	conclusions	through	mathematical	deduction.	Religion
has	arrived	at	its	conclusions	through	belief.	But	the	yogi	is	a	hard	nut	who	will	not	settle	for
deduction	or	belief.	He	or	she	seeks	to	 _experience_ 	the	ultimate	through	the	enhancement	of
individual	 perception.	 Consequently,	 the	 yogic	 tradition	 does	 not	 mention	 God,	 or	 deny	 it
either.

The	 human	 longing	 to	 expand	 is	 actually	 just	 an	 expression	 of	 the	 ultimate	 formless
intelligence	that	is	the	very	source	of	who	we	are.	Instead	of	trying	to	find	the	source	of	our
longing,	we	try	to	give	it	expression	in	the	outside	world.	Due	to	the	nature	of	our	outward-
bound	senses,	we	are	deceived	into	believing	that	outward	expression	will	somehow	bring
fulfillment.	 When	 you	 misinterpret	 the	 expression	 as	 the	 cause,	 it	 will	 only	 bring
entanglement,	not	freedom.

The	sole	aim	of	every	individual’s	life	energies	is	to	touch	the	infinite—the	very	core	of
our	making.	They	know	no	other	aim.	Your	mind	may	be	thinking	of	money	or	a	new	house,
your	body	may	be	longing	for	food	or	sleep,	but	your	life	energies	are	always	longing	to
break	the	boundaries	set	by	your	physical	and	mental	structures.	Slowly,	in	the	process	of
living,	many	people	have	stopped	following	the	trajectory	of	their	life	energies.	The	result	is
that	they	start	believing	that	they	are	separate	or	autonomous	entities.

But	separateness	is	a	myth.	The	content	of	both	your	physical	and	mental	bodies	has	been
gathered	from	the	outside.	They	belong	to	you	but	they	are	not	you.	If	you	want	to	go	the	way
your	body	is	going	currently,	you	should	know	that	it	is	going	straight	to	the	grave.	Similarly,
whatever	 you	 know	 as	 the	 mind	 is	 a	 complex	 mess	 of	 all	 the	 stuff	 that	 it	 has	 been
accumulating.	The	objectives	of	the	mind	are	entirely	self-created.	They	may	seem	to	be	fine
right	now,	but	they	usually	take	you	completely	away	from	the	process	of	life.	So,	if	you	go
the	 way	 your	 mind	 goes,	 you	 should	 know	 you	 are	 heading	 toward	 an	 alternative
psychological	creation;	it	may	be	fascinating,	stimulating,	or	even	comforting	for	a	length	of
time,	but	it	bears	no	relation	at	all	to	existential	reality.

The	entire	yogic	process	is	aimed	at	aligning	oneself	with	the	natural	longing	of	life	to
expand	 in	 an	 unlimited	 way.	 It	 gives	 conscious	 expression	 to	 this	 basic	 human	 need.	 The


various	spiritual	practices	in	the	yogic	sciences	are	intended	to	assist	this	longing	on	three
levels:	 the	 physical	 body,	 the	 mental	 body,	 and	 the	 third	 sheath,	 or	 layer,	 of	 the	 human
mechanism,	the	 _pranamayakosha,_ 	or	the	energy	body.

Yoga	means	to	experience	the	mental	and	physical	process	distinctly,	not	as	the	basis	of
yourself,	but	as	 _that	which	is	caused	by	you_ .	If	you	manage	these	two	instruments	of	body	and
mind	consciously,	then	your	experience	of	life	is	one	hundred	percent	of	your	making.	All
you	need	to	do	is	create	a	distance	between	you	and	everything	that	you	accumulated	from
outside.

Everything	 that	 you	 have	 gathered	 in	 this	 life	 accompanies	 you	 wherever	 you	 go.	 It	 is
deeply	attached	to	you,	and	you,	in	turn,	are	deeply	attached	to	it,	on	some	unconscious	level.
It	becomes	an	encumbrance	because	you	don’t	know	when	to	put	it	down	and	when	to	pick	it
up.	It	is	like	a	sack	you	carry	on	your	shoulders	all	the	time.

But	it	 _is_ 	possible	for	you	to	put	it	down.	It	will	still	be	your	companion,	but	at	least	it	won’t
be	that	burdensome!	It	is	definitely	possible	to	create	some	distance	between	you	and	what	you
have	gathered.	You	can	use	it	when	you	want,	but	you	need	not	be	identified	with	it.	If	you
cannot	maintain	this	distance,	your	whole	vision	of	life	will	be	clouded.	Your	memory	and
your	 imagination—which	 includes	 all	 your	 ideas,	 beliefs,	 and	 emotions—belong	 to	 the
psychological	 realm.	 _Life	 can	 be	 tasted	 and	 transcended	 only	 when	 there	 is	 a	 distinction
between	the	psychological	and	the	existential._

The	spiritual	process	means	a	return	to	life.	It	means	following	the	deep	intelligence	of
your	life	energies.	There	are	many	ways	of	recognizing	which	way	your	life	energies	want	to
go.	If	you	dis-identify	with	physiological	and	psychological	processes,	you	will	clearly	see
this.	It	is	only	when	you	consciously	head	in	the	direction	of	your	life	energies	that	you	find
equanimity	and	harmony.	It	is	only	in	such	a	stable	state	that	you	would	dare	to	explore	the
highest	levels	of	exuberance	and	venture	into	the	deepest	mysteries	of	life.


```
PAIN	NOT	SUFFERING
```
In	my	motorcycle	days,	I	used	to	ride	all	over	the	country.	One	day	when	I	was
in	a	remote	area,	a	freak	accident	occurred,	and	my	calf	muscle	was	slashed
right	up	to	the	bone.	So	I	went	to	a	local	clinic	and	asked	the	doctor	to	fix	my
leg.	 The	 doctor	 examined	 the	 wound	 and	 said	 there	 was	 no	 way	 he	 could,
because	 he	 had	 no	 anesthetic	 facility.	 He	 suggested	 that	 I	 rush	 to	 a	 bigger
hospital	and	seek	immediate	medical	attention.	I	said	I	didn’t	have	the	time,	that
I	had	to	continue	my	journey	because	I	had	a	schedule	to	meet.	I	told	him	he
had	to	fix	it.	He	refused.	I	was	bleeding	profusely.	After	much	argument,	he
gave	in	because	a	pool	of	blood	was	gathering	where	I	stood.	So	without	any
anesthesia,	he	began	to	put	my	muscle	together,	which	took	about	fifty-two
sutures	on	three	different	levels.	Through	this	entire	process,	I	was	having	a
conversation	with	him.	He	was	sweating	and	puffing	through	it	all.	After	it	was
over,	he	asked	me	incredulously,	“Is	there	no	pain	in	your	leg	at	all?”

There	 _was_ pain.	 Terrible,	 unbearable	 pain.	 But	 pain	 is	 a	 natural
phenomenon,	and	it	is	good.	Without	it	you	wouldn’t	know	if	your	leg	was
chopped	off.	But	suffering	is	another	matter	altogether.	Pain	is	bad	enough;
why	 make	 it	 worse	 with	 suffering?	 Suffering	 is	 entirely	 self-created.	 And
every	human	being	has	the	choice:	to	suffer	or	not	to	suffer.	It	doesn’t	take
much	intelligence	to	choose	the	latter.


**The	Karmic	Conundrum**

Once	it	happened...On	a	certain	day,	Shankaran	Pillai	was	sitting	in	a	bar	with	his	buddies.
Suddenly,	 the	 clock	 struck	 eight.	 Shankaran	 Pillai	 put	 down	 his	 glass,	 rose,	 and	 starting
walking	toward	the	door.

His	friends	said,	“Hey,	what’s	the	problem?	Where	are	you	going?	Why	don’t	you	finish
your	drink?”	But	Shankaran	Pillai	kept	walking	wordlessly,	zombielike,	toward	the	door.

The	friends	laughed	and	said,	“Okay,	now	we	know!	It’s	eight	o’clock	and	you	have	to	be
home.	You’re	afraid	of	your	wife,	aren’t	you?	What	are	you—a	man	or	a	mouse?”

Shankaran	Pillai	stopped,	turned	around,	and	said,	“I	am	the	man	of	the	house.	If	I	were	a
mouse,	my	wife	would	be	afraid	of	me!”

He	walked	slowly	home.	His	wife’s	rule	was	that	he	should	reach	home	by	eight.	Today,	the
man-mouse	argument	and	his	slow,	inebriated	pace	had	delayed	him.	His	wife	was	sitting	on
the	porch,	rolling	pin	in	hand.	She	glowered	at	him	and	said,	“You	fool,	once	again	drinking?
Come	here	and	I’ll	show	you.”

Shankaran	Pillai	was	a	frail	but	agile	man.	He	walked	toward	her	meekly,	but	then	suddenly
leapt	over	her	and	ran	into	the	house.	She	rose	and	lumbered	in	after	him.	He	made	her	run	all
over	 the	 house,	 confident	 that	 she	 would	 never	 be	 able	 to	 catch	 him.	 After	 much	 running
around,	he	darted	into	the	bedroom	and	dove	under	the	bed.	She	rushed	behind	him.	She	was	a
big	 woman	 and	 could	 not	 slip	 under	 the	 bed.	 He	 lay	 there,	 secure,	 as	 she	 hollered,	 “You
coward!	What	are	you	doing	there	under	the	bed?	Come	on	out!	Are	you	a	man	or	a	mouse?”

Shankaran	 Pillai	 replied,	 “I	 am	 the	 man	 of	 this	 house.	 I	 have	 the	 freedom	 to	 lie	 down
wherever	I	want.”

It	was	the	only	place	he	could	be	at	that	moment,	but	he	needed	to	claim	it	was	his	freedom!
Unfortunately,	most	human	beings	are	doing	much	the	same	thing:	they	are	labeling	their
compulsions,	their	limitations,	as	their	choices.	If	you	can	joyfully	do	whatever	is	needed	in	a
given	 situation,	 this	 is	 freedom.	 But	 limiting	 yourself	 to	 doing	 only	 what	 you	 like	 is	 a
horribly	 compulsive	 way	 to	 live.	 This	 compulsiveness	 is	 the	 trick	 of	 _karma_ —that	 ancient
word	that	has	been	mangled	by	popular	usage	across	the	world.

What	exactly	 _is_ 	karma?
“Karma”	literally	means	“action.”	Action	is	of	three	kinds.	It	could	be	in	terms	of	the	body,
mind,	or	energy.	Whatever	you	do	with	your	body,	mind,	or	energy,	leaves	a	certain	residue.
This	residue	forms	a	pattern	of	its	own,	and	these	resultant	patterns	stay	with	you.	When	you
gather	a	huge	volume	of	impressions,	slowly	these	shape	themselves	into	tendencies,	and	you
become	like	an	automatic	toy,	a	slave	to	your	patterns,	a	puppet	of	your	past.


Karma	is	like	old	software	that	you	have	written	for	yourself,	unconsciously.	Depending	on
the	type	of	actions	that	you	perform,	you	write	your	software.	Once	you	write	a	certain	type
of	software,	your	whole	system	functions	accordingly.	Based	on	the	information	from	the
past,	certain	memory	patterns	are	formed	and	keep	recurring.	Now,	life	is	just	cyclical.

This	is	why	the	same	patterns	keep	returning	in	your	life.	There	are	a	few	variations,	but
they	remain	essentially	the	same,	repeating	themselves	across	generations.	After	a	while,	this
repetitiveness	can	be	deadly.	It	is	important	to	see	that	these	patterns	rule	you	from	within,	not
from	without.	No	one	has	to	exercise	any	external	control	upon	you.	Your	inner	autocrat	rules
you	all	the	time.	You	may	think	it	is	a	new	day.	Circumstances	may	change,	but	internally	you
are	experiencing	the	same	thing	over	and	over	again.	And	so,	the	more	things	change,	the
more	they	stay	the	same—not	physically	but	experientially!	You	are	helplessly	stuck	in	the
karmic	rut.

Freedom	is	now	an	empty	word	because	the	way	you	think,	feel,	and	understand	life—even
the	way	you	sit,	stand,	and	move—is	conditioned	by	your	past	impressions.	From	the	moment
you	were	born,	your	parents,	your	family,	your	education,	your	friends,	where	you	lived,	and
where	 you	 traveled—all	 this	 decided	 everything	 about	 you.	 Karma	 is	 encrypted	 on	 every
aspect	of	life.	It	is	imprinted	on	your	mental	memory,	the	fundamentals	of	your	body,	your
chemistry,	your	very	energy.	These	are	all	backup	systems.	Even	if	you	lose	your	body	or
your	mind,	you	still	do	not	lose	your	karma!	The	backup	systems	are	so	efficient.

What	you	consider	to	be	your	personality—the	bundle	of	traits	and	tendencies	that	you	are
—is	because	of	information	you	have	gathered	unconsciously.	These	tendencies	have	been
traditionally	described	as	 _vasanas_ .	 The	 word	 “vasana”	 literally	 means	 “smell.”	 Depending
upon	what	type	of	garbage	is	in	the	bin	today,	that	is	the	kind	of	smell	that	will	emanate	from
it.	Depending	upon	what	type	of	smell	you	emit,	you	attract	certain	kinds	of	life	situations	to
yourself.

Suppose	today	there	is	rotten	fish	in	the	garbage	bin.	It	may	stink	for	you,	but	many	other
creatures	 are	 drawn	 to	 it.	 Tomorrow,	 if	 there	 are	 flowers	 in	 the	 garbage	 bin,	 it	 smells
different	and	still	other	creatures	are	drawn	to	it.

When	I	first	went	down	south	to	the	city	of	Coimbatore	almost	thirty	years	ago,	I	stayed	as
a	 guest	 in	 a	 physician’s	 house.	 He	 was	 a	 gregarious	 man	 and	 told	 me	 of	 an	 incident	 that
happened	in	his	family.	They	were	from	a	coastal	region	in	India,	and	his	elder	daughter	was
particularly	fond	of	fish.	She	was	studying	up	north	in	the	hills	of	Dehradun	where	she	did	not
get	fish	to	eat,	so	whenever	she	came	home	for	her	vacation,	she	wanted	to	have	it	every	day.
His	wife	was	a	vegetarian,	but	she	would	cook	fish	even	though	she	did	not	eat	it.

There	is	a	particular	small	dried	fish	that	you	would	know	if	you	are	from	that	part	of	the
country.	It	has	an	incredible	odor.	If	it	is	being	carried	in	a	truck,	you	would	like	to	drive	two
miles	behind	the	truck	or	hold	your	breath	as	you	pass	it.	Cooking	it	in	the	house	is	a	pretty
good	strategy	to	evict	your	neighbors	from	their	home!	This	girl	wanted	 _that_ 	particular	fish
to	be	prepared.

So	as	they	were	frying	this	dried	fish,	it	was	as	if	the	entire	house	was	being	fumigated.
Such	an	odor	could	raise	the	dead!	The	mother	went	into	the	kitchen	to	tell	the	cooks	how	to


prepare	it,	but	the	moment	the	stink	began	to	emanate	from	the	frying	pan,	she	ran	out	of	the
kitchen	because	she	could	not	stand	it.	Meanwhile,	the	girl,	who	was	in	her	bedroom,	also
smelled	it	and	ran	out,	following	the	scent.	Both	mother	and	daughter	crashed	headlong	into
each	other—and	the	mother	ended	up	with	a	broken	nose!

I	mention	this	incident	not	as	an	illustration	of	reward	and	punishment	but	as	an	illustration
of	the	possible	consequences	of	strong	attachment	and	aversion.	When	these	dominate	your
life,	 some	 kind	 of	 smashup	 is	 inevitable.	 Vasanas,	 or	 tendencies,	 are	 generated	 by	 a	 vast
accumulation	of	impressions	caused	by	your	physical,	mental,	and	energy	actions.	What	you
call	your	personality	is	just	an	expression	of	these	tendencies.

Now,	today	if	you	are	doing	something	in	a	particular	way	and	someone	asks	you	why	you
can’t	do	it	differently,	you	often	declare,	“This	is	my	nature.	Can’t	I	do	what	I	want?”	This	is
_not_ 	your	nature.	You	are	 _not_ 	doing	what	you	want.	These	tendencies	have	become	compulsive.
This	is	your	bondage,	a	kind	of	software	you	are	writing	for	yourself	unconsciously.	Once
your	software	is	fixed,	it	looks	as	if	there	is	only	one	path	you	can	walk	in	your	life.	It	looks
as	if	your	destiny	is	predetermined.	A	spiritual	process,	however,	means	we	have	made	up	our
minds	to	rewrite	our	software,	 _consciously_.

In	India,	“karma”	is	a	common	word.	If	people	exhibit	any	kind	of	compulsive	behavior,
others	will	immediately	say,	“Oh,	that	is	their	karma.”	This	means	that	it	is	 _of their	 making_.
The	 bitterness	 or	 sweetness	 of	 any	 experience	 is	 not	 in	 the	 event	 itself,	 but	 in	 how	 you
perceive	and	respond	to	it.	What	is	a	very	bitter	experience	for	one	person	could	be	a	blessing
for	another.

Once	a	grief-stricken	man	sat	by	a	gravestone,	crying	bitterly	and	hitting	his	head	against	it.
“My	life!	Oh,	how	senseless	it	is.	My	body	is	a	worthless	carcass	now	that	you	have	gone.	If
only	you	had	lived!	If	only	fate	had	not	been	so	cruel!	If	only	you	hadn’t	left,	how	different
my	life	would	have	been!”

A	 clergyman	 nearby	 overheard	 him	 and	 said,	 “I	 assume	 the	 person	 lying	 beneath	 this
mound	of	earth	was	someone	of	great	importance	to	you?”

“Importance?	 Yes,	 indeed!”	 wept	 the	 man,	 wailing	 even	 louder.	 “It	 was	 my	 wife’s	 first
husband!”

So,	the	quality	of	your	life	is	always	decided	by	 _how_ 	you	experience	life,	not	by	 _what_ 	life
offers	you.

It	is	important	to	remember	that	karma	is	not	a	negative	word.	Karma	is	what	gives	stability
and	 structure	 to	 your	 life.	 Every	 moment,	 impressions	 are	 flooding	 in	 torrents	 into	 your
system	through	your	five	sense	organs	and	each	of	them	is	being	recorded.	There	is	nothing
wrong	with	this	stored	information.	It	is	very	useful	for	your	survival.	If	you	deleted	all	of	it,
you	would	not	know	how	to	handle	even	the	simplest	aspects	of	life.	The	spiritual	process
does	not	seek	to	demolish	this	storehouse	of	karmic	impressions,	but	helps	you	to	become
more	conscious	of	it,	and	establish	a	little	space,	which	allows	you	to	stand	outside	of	it.

So,	your	software	is	not	in	itself	the	problem.	It	turns	into	a	problem	only	if	it	becomes	the
ruling	 factor	 in	 your	 life.	 To	 talk	 of	 good	 karma	 and	 bad	 karma	 is	 like	 talking	 of	 good
bondage	and	bad	bondage.	There	is	no	such	thing.	Karma	is	just	your	own	creation.	It	is


neither	good	nor	bad.	It	is	software	that	can	be	useful	if	you	have	some	freedom	from	it.	This
is	all	the	spiritual	process	aims	to	do:	loosen	the	grip	of	karma	upon	you.	Whatever	be	the
nature	of	your	past	karma,	there	is	enough	awareness	in	a	human	being	to	take	complete
charge	of	the	karma	of	the	present	moment.

If	you	want	any	kind	of	transformation,	any	kind	of	forward	movement	in	your	life,	it	can
only	happen	if	you	break	the	cyclical	patterns	of	karma.	Anything	that	is	cyclical	suggests
constant	motion,	but	it	doesn’t	really	go	anywhere.	If	you	are	sensitive	to	life,	you	realize	this
early.	If	you	are	less	sensitive,	you	realize	this	as	you	grow	older.	Everything	may	seem	to	be
going	your	way:	your	professional	life	may	be	flourishing,	your	capital	may	be	increasing,
your	family	may	be	thriving,	but	 _you_ 	are	not	really	getting	anywhere.	The	faster	you	achieve
your	success,	the	faster	you	realize	this.	When	you	are	in	a	certain	state	of	insufficiency,	you
keep	thinking	that	everything	will	be	okay	once	your	dreams	are	realized.	But	if	all	the	things
you	 dreamt	 of	 happen	 very	 quickly,	 you	 suddenly	 realize	 that,	 although	 everything	 is
happening	as	you	thought	it	should,	life	still	remains	unfulfilled	and	your	longings	persist.

Until	you	break	this	cycle,	there	is	no	real	choice	in	your	life.	Sometimes,	you	may	have
felt	 you	 have	 experienced	 a	 breakthrough.	 Things	 seem	 to	 have	 changed,	 and	 everything
seems	great	for	the	next	three	days,	but	on	the	fourth	day,	you	fall	back	into	the	same	rut.
Hasn’t	this	happened	to	you	any	number	of	times?	That	is	because	there	is	no	freedom	of
thought,	emotion,	action,	and,	above	all,	no	freedom	of	experience	as	long	as	you	are	in	the
karmic	grip.

At	the	same	time,	avoiding	karma	is	not	the	answer	either.	Avoidance	may	give	you	some
balance	and	stability	in	day-to-day	life,	but	slowly	it	saps	you	of	life	and	joy.	This	is	very
negative	karma	in	itself.	Denying,	suppressing,	or	avoiding	life	brings	more	bondage	than
freedom.	The	desire,	“I	don’t	want	karma,”	is	itself	a	big	karma!

The	very	process	of	living	is	itself	a	dissolution	of	karma.	If	you	live	every	moment	of
your	life	totally,	you	dissolve	enormous	amounts	of	karma.	When	you	experience	everything
that	comes	your	way	absolutely,	when	you	experience	every	life	breath	with	utmost	intensity,
without	the	distractions	of	thought	and	emotion,	devoid	of	any	psychological	drama,	you	are
liberated	from	the	very	process	of	birth	and	death.	You	are	not	only	more	alive;	you	 _are_ 	life
itself.

Yoga	offers	a	way	to	distance	yourself	not	just	from	your	karma,	but	from	the	very	source
of	karma,	which	is	the	discriminatory	intellect.	It	offers	you	the	choice	every	moment	of	your
existence	to	be	either	a	victim	or	a	spectator	or	the	very	master	of	your	life.	With	a	certain
amount	 of	 effort	 and	 practice	 we	 all	 can	 write	 a	 software	 of	 joy	 and	 well-being	 for
themselves.

Sadhana


When	you	realize	that	all	your	material	achievements	are	of	value	only	in	comparison	with	those	who
don’t	have	them,	this	is	joy	that	springs	from	another’s	deprivation.	Can	you	really	call	this	joy?	Isn’t	it
actually	a	kind	of	sickness?	It	is	time	everyone	addressed	this.	If	you	were	alone	on	this	planet,	what
would	you	want	for	yourself?	Ask	yourself	this	question	and	see	where	it	takes	you.
Try	this.	Sit	alone	for	five	minutes	and	see	what	your	life	would	be	like	if	you	were	absolutely	alone	in
this	world.	If	there	were	nobody	or	nothing	to	compare	yourself	with,	what	would	you	truly	long	for?
What	would	really	matter	to	you	if	there	were	no	external	appreciation	or	critique?	If	you	do	this	every
day,	you	will	become	aligned	with	the	longings	of	the	life	that	you	are,	rather	than	the	accumulated	karmic
mess	that	you	believe	you	are.


**The	Mechanics	of	Life**

Fundamentally,	 _kriya_ 	means	“internal	action.”	An	internal	action	is	one	that	does	not	involve
either	the	body	or	the	mind	or	the	physical	dimensions	of	energy.	As	we	have	established
earlier,	the	body	and	the	mind	are	yours,	but	still	external	to	you.	You	have	gathered	both
from	the	outside:	the	body	is	an	accumulation	of	food,	and	the	mind	an	accumulation	of	ideas.
Even	the	imprints	upon	the	energy	body	are	an	accumulation	of	the	impressions	of	the	five
senses.	 When	 you	 have	 the	 ability	 to	 perform	 action	 with	 the	 _non-physical	 aspect	 of	 your
energy_ ,	then	it	is	termed	a	“kriya.”	All	this	may	sound	somewhat	esoteric,	but	only	if	you	are
inducted	by	someone	who	has	mastery	over	the	realms	of	energy	will	it	become	possible	for
you	to	practice	a	kriya.

If	your	actions	find	outward	expression,	involving	body,	mind,	and	the	physical	dimensions
of	energy,	that	is	karma.	But	if	you	turn	inward	and	perform	an	action	beyond	all	dimensions
of	physicality,	that	is	kriya.	Karma	is	the	process	of	binding	you.	Kriya	is	the	process	of
liberating	you.	The	most	significant	aspect	of	yoga	is	always	to	perform	action	beyond	the
physical	 dimensions	 of	 energy.	 Among	 the	 four	 dimensions	 of	 physicality,	 you	 are	 most
conscious	of	bodily	actions,	less	of	the	mental,	much	less	of	the	emotional,	and	negligibly	of
the	energetic.	The	moment	you	learn	to	perform	action	with	the	non-physical	aspect	of	your
life	energy,	you	suddenly	move	to	a	new	level	of	freedom	within	and	outside	of	yourself.

How	do	you	access	the	non-physical	aspect	of	your	life	energy?	The	yogic	practices,	which
involve	 postures,	 breath,	 attitudes	 of	 the	 mind,	 and	 energy	 activation,	 are	 all	 essentially
oriented	toward	aligning	the	first	three	layers	of	the	body:	the	physical,	the	mental,	and	the
energetic	 body.	 It	 is	 only	 in	 aligning	 them	 that	 you	 find	 access	 to	 dimensions	 beyond	 the
physical—to	the	fundamental	life	energy	itself.

I	have	seen	any	number	of	people	who	start	doing	a	simple	kriya,	and	suddenly	become	so
creative	that	they	are	able	to	achieve	things	that	they	never	imagined	possible	in	their	lives.
This	is	simply	because	they	loosened	their	karmic	foundations	a	little.	They	shook	up	their
life	energies	for	a	change,	instead	of	being	entangled	with	their	physical	processes	of	body,
mind,	and	energy.	This	is	something	every	human	being	can	learn	to	do.

Kriya	yoga	is	a	very	powerful	way	to	walk	the	spiritual	path,	but	at	the	same	time	it	is
tremendously	demanding.	For	many	modern	urban	people	who	are	unaccustomed	to	using
their	body	in	its	full	versatility,	kriya	yoga	could	seem	arduous	and	inhuman.	This	is	because
kriyas	are	elaborate	and	involve	a	great	deal	of	discipline,	focus,	and	exactitude.	Most	people
do	not	have	the	body,	the	attitude,	or	the	stability	of	emotion	for	this	yoga	path,	primarily
because	they	are	used	to	living,	right	from	their	childhood,	in	a	perpetual	state	of	comfort.
Being	used	to	a	level	of	physical	comfort	is	not	a	problem.	But	being	in	constant	quest	of
comfort:	this	is	a	great	problem.	That	kind	of	attitude	and	emotion	is	unsuitable	for	the	path	of


kriya	yoga.

Also,	kriya	yoga	cannot	be	done	with	people	who	talk	“freedom”	all	the	time.	It	is	not	for
people	who	 keep	 asking,	 “Why	 am	 I	 not	 free	to	 eat	 my	 ice	 cream?	 Why	 can’t	 I	 wake	 up
whenever	I	feel	like	it?	Why	can’t	I	eat,	drink,	or	have	sex	with	whatever,	whoever,	whenever	I
feel	like?”	If	you	take	the	path	of	kriya,	a	certain	fundamental	discipline	has	to	be	brought	into
all	 physical,	 psychological,	 and	 emotional	 processes.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 hit	 the	 peak	 of	 your
consciousness,	 this	 discipline	 is	 essential.	 You	 cannot	 be	 partying	 till	 early	 morning	 and
attempt	to	scale	Mount	Everest	tomorrow!	The	same	logic	holds	true	here.

When	 you	 are	 given	 a	 certain	 kriya	 yoga	 regimen,	 you	 have	 to	 follow	 it.	 You	 may
understand	the	need	for	the	discipline	as	you	go	along,	but	it	can	never	be	fully	explained.
And	if	it	has	to	be	explained,	the	essence	of	the	kriya	will	be	lost.	This	is	because	kriya	is	a
tool	to	transcend	the	framework	of	logic	and	experience	in	order	to	access	those	non-physical
dimensions	that	are	considered	spiritual	or	mystical.

If	I	wanted	to	teach	you	kriyas	just	as	practices,	it	would	be	simple	to	put	them	in	a	book
from	which	you	could	learn	and	memorize	them.	But	for	the	kriya	to	be	a	live	process,	to	be
imprinted	 in	 your	 system	 in	 a	 certain	 way,	 it	 needs	 a	 certain	 discipline,	 dedication,	 and
receptivity.	When	you	walk	a	completely	new	terrain,	if	there	is	no	trust	in	the	one	who	guides
you,	then	the	journey	becomes	unnecessarily	long	and	difficult.

Generally,	on	the	path	of	kriya,	most	gurus	make	the	disciples	wait.	Traditionally,	when
students	went	to	a	guru	to	learn	kriya	yoga,	they	might	well	have	been	told	to	sweep	the	floor
for	a	year,	and	then	wash	the	dishes	for	another!	If	their	trust	still	did	not	waver,	then	the	guru
might	consider	initiating	them	into	the	kriyas.	There	is	a	reason	for	this.	Once	you	empower
people	in	a	particular	way	that	makes	their	system	vibrant	beyond	normal	standards,	they	can
cause	great	damage	to	themselves	if	their	attitudes	and	emotions	are	not	as	they	should	be.	But
in	today’s	world,	to	get	that	kind	of	time	with	people,	to	arrive	at	that	kind	of	trust	and	then
imprint	these	kriyas,	is	difficult.	It	is	not	impossible,	but	the	chances	are	remote.

I	 spent	 twenty-one	 years	 of	 my	 life	 transforming	 a	 powerful	 kriya,	 the	 _Shambhavi
Mahamudra,_ 	in	order	that	it	might	be	taught	to	large	numbers	of	people	in	today’s	world.
Certain	aspects	that	could	empower	people	either	to	harm	themselves	or	others,	or	influence
the	 elements	 around	 them	 have	 been	 firewalled,	 so	 only	 the	 physical,	 psychological,	 and
spiritual	benefits	remain.	For	those	two	decades	I	deliberately	stayed	away	from	all	forms	of
public	outreach,	because	my	entire	focus	was	primarily	on	re-crafting	the	kriya	to	ensure	that
it	could	be	widely	imparted	without	any	adverse	effects.

Kriya	 yoga	 as	 a	 full-fledged	 path	 is	 important	 only	 for	 those	 interested	 in	 exploring
mystical	dimensions.	If	your	concern	is	only	well-being	or	if	you	are	just	seeking	realization,
kriyas	 can	 be	 used	 in	 a	 small	 way.	 But	 kriya	 yoga	 as	 an	 exclusive	 path	 is	 not	 necessary
because	it	requires	too	much	application.

If	you	follow	the	path	of	kriya	very	intensely	without	guidance,	it	may	take	a	few	lifetimes
to	bear	fruit.	If	you	have	someone	to	actively	guide	the	process,	kriya	can	be	a	most	powerful
and	magnificent	way	to	explore	the	inner	nature	and	mystical	phenomena.	Otherwise	kriya	is
a	 somewhat	 roundabout	 route.	 What	 you	 are	 seeking	 on	 this	 path	 is	 not	 just	 well-being,


blissfulness,	or	realization.	Instead,	you	want	to	know	the	very	mechanics	of	life-making;	you
want	to	know	the	engineering	of	life.	That	is	why	it	is	a	much	longer	process.

People	on	the	kriya	path	have	a	completely	different	kind	of	presence	about	them	because
of	the	mastery	over	their	energies.	They	can	dismantle	life	and	put	it	back	together.	If	you	are
pursuing	the	path	of	gnana,	for	example,	your	intellect	could	become	razor-sharp,	but	there	is
still	very	little	you	can	do	with	your	energies.	Similarly,	on	the	path	of	bhakti,	or	devotion _,_
there	is	nothing	much	you	can	do	with	your	energies.	(Nor	do	you	care,	because	the	intense
sweetness	of	your	emotions	is	all	that	matters;	you	only	want	to	dissolve	into	the	object	of
your	devotion.)	If	you	are	on	the	path	of	karma,	you	can	do	many	things	in	the	external	world,
but	you	can	do	nothing	with	yourself.	Kriya	yogis,	on	the	other	hand,	can	do	whatever	they
wish	with	their	inner	world,	and	achieve	a	great	deal	in	the	outer	world	as	well.

Sadhana

```
The	very	way	the	karmic	structure	works	in	every	human	being	is	essentially	cyclical.	If	you	observe	very
closely,	within	a	day	the	same	cycles	are	happening	many	times	over.	If	you	are	very	observant,	you	will
see	that	every	forty	minutes	you	are	going	through	a	physiological	cycle.	Once	you	see	that,	then	with	the
necessary	 attention	 and	 awareness	 you	 can	 ride	 the	 cycle	 and	 move	 toward	 transcendence	 from	 the
limitations	 that	 these	 cycles	 set.	 So,	 every	 forty	 minutes,	 life	 presents	 you	 with	 an	 opportunity—the
opportunity	to	become	conscious.
Every	forty	to	forty-eight	minutes,	there	is	also	a	shift	of	dominance	in	the	way	the	breath	is	moving
through	the	right	and	left	nostrils.	It	is	dominant	in	the	right	nostril	for	a	length	of	time,	and	then	in	the	left.
Become	 aware	 of	 this	 so	 you	 know	 at	 least	 something	 about	 you	 is	 changing.	 This	 awareness	 can	 be
further	 enhanced	 into	 awareness	 of	 the	 solar	 and	 lunar	 influences	 upon	 the	 body.	 If	 you	 bring	 your
physical	 system	 in	 sync	 with	 the	 lunar	 and	 solar	 cycles,	 your	 physical	 and	 psychological	 health	 is
guaranteed.
```

**The	Energy	Labyrinth**

The	yogic	system	offers	us	a	comprehensive	and	elaborate	view	of	the	anatomy	of	the	human
energy	body.	It	has	mapped	seventy-two	thousand	channels	(or	 _nadis,_ 	as	they	are	called)	in	the
energy	 system.	 The	 _prana,_ or	 energy,	 moves	 through	 these	 channels.	 These	 seventy-two
thousand	 channels	 spring,	 in	 turn,	 from	 three	 basic	 channels.	 The	 channel	 on	 the	 right	 is
known	as	 _pingala,_ 	the	left	is	known	as	 _ida,_ 	and	the	central	is	known	as	 _sushumna_.

These	 three	 channels	 are	 the	 basis	 of	 the	 energy	 system.	 Pingala	 is	 symbolized	 as	 the
masculine	and	ida	is	symbolized	as	the	feminine.	“Masculine”	and	“feminine”	do	not	refer
here	to	biological	differences,	but	to	certain	qualities	in	nature	that	have	been	identified	as
such.	These	qualities	are	represented	by	these	two	channels.

If	 a	 person’s	 pingala	 is	 very	 pronounced,	 then	 outgoing,	 exploratory	 qualities	 will	 be
dominant.	If	the	ida	is	more	pronounced,	receptive	and	reflective	qualities	will	be	dominant.
Whether	one	is	a	man	or	woman	has	nothing	to	do	with	this.	You	may	be	a	man,	but	the	ida
may	be	more	dominant;	you	may	be	a	woman,	but	the	pingala	may	be	more	dominant.

The	pingala	and	ida	are	also	symbolized	as	the	sun	and	the	moon—the	sun	representing	the
masculine,	 and	 moon	 representing	 the	 feminine.	 The	 sun	 is	 aggressive	 and	 outgoing;	 the
moon	receives	and	reflects.	The	cycles	of	the	moon	are	deeply	connected	with	the	female
body	 as	 well.	 On	 the	 level	 of	 your	 mind,	 pingala	 represents	 the	 logical	 dimension;	 ida
represents	the	intuitive	dimension.	These	two	dualities	are	the	fundamentals	of	the	physical
sphere	of	life.	A	human	being	is	complete	only	when	both	the	masculine	and	the	feminine
function	at	full	force	and	are	in	proper	balance.

Sushumna,	 the	 central	 nadi,	 is	 the	 most	 significant	 aspect	 of	 your	 physiology,	 yet	 it
generally	goes	unexplored.	It	is	independent	of	the	seventy-two	thousand	nadis,	but	it	is	the
fulcrum	of	the	whole	system.	Once	the	energies	enter	your	sushumna,	irrespective	of	what	is
happening	 around	 you,	 you	 have	 a	 certain	 balance.	 Right	 now,	 you	 may	 be	 reasonably
balanced,	but	if	the	outside	situation	is	challenging,	you	will	also	be	disturbed.	Once	energies
enter	the	sushumna,	however,	your	inner	way	of	being	becomes	independent	of	the	outside,
because	it	is	independent	of	the	seventy-two	thousand	nadis.

There	is	a	great	deal	of	 _chakra_ 	talk	nowadays.	“Chakra _”_ 	means	“wheel,”	and	has	a	very
specific	meaning	and	significance	in	the	yogic	system.	These	days	there	are	“wheel	alignment
centers”	that	claim	to	balance	your	chakras,	clear	your	blocks,	and	heal	you	of	ailments,	past,
present,	and	future.	Lots	of	people	are	“doing”	chakras	these	days.	It	has	become	a	huge	fad,
but	it	can	be	dangerous.	It	is	time	to	approach	this	very	subtle	subject	with	care	and	precision.

The	nadis	do	not	have	a	physical	manifestation.	If	you	cut	the	body	and	look	inside,	you
will	not	find	them.	But	as	you	become	more	aware,	you	will	notice	the	energy	is	not	moving
at	random	but	in	established	pathways.


The	chakras	are	powerful	centers	in	the	physiology	where	the	nadis	meet	in	a	particular
way	to	create	an	energy	vortex.	Like	the	nadis,	the	chakras	are	of	a	subtle	nature	and	do	not
have	a	physical	existence.	They	always	meet	in	the	form	of	a	triangle	(not	a	circle,	as	the	word
“chakra”	 suggests).	 The	 moving	 part	 in	 a	 machine	 is	 always	 a	 circle,	 because	 a	 circle	 is
capable	of	movement	with	least	resistance.	These	energy	centers	are	so	named	because	the
wheel	suggests	movement	or	dynamism.

There	are	114	chakras	in	the	body.	Two	are	outside	the	body	and	112	are	within	the	body.
Among	 these	 112,	 there	 are	 7	 major	 chakras.	 For	 most	 people,	 3	 of	 these	 are	 active;	 the
remaining	are	either	dormant	or	mildly	active.	You	do	not	have	to	activate	all	114	chakras	to
live	a	physical	life.	You	can	live	quite	a	complete	life	with	just	a	few	of	them.	If	you	were	to
activate	all	114	chakras,	you	would	have	no	sense	of	body	at	all.	The	purpose	of	yoga	is	to
activate	your	energy	system	in	such	a	way	that	your	body	consciousness	is	constantly	being
lowered,	so	you	can	sit	here	 _in_ 	the	body,	but	 _are_ 	no	longer	the	body.

In	 southern	 India,	 there	 was	 a	 legendary	 yogi	 named	 Sadashiva	 Brahmendra.	 He	 was	 a
_nirkaya,_ 	which	literally	means	“bodiless	yogi.”	He	had	no	sense	of	body.	Wearing	clothes
does	not	even	occur	to	a	person	in	such	a	state.	He	just	walked	around	naked.	Also	in	such	a
condition,	there	is	no	sense	of	home,	property,	or	physical	boundary.

One	day,	he	happened	to	walk	into	the	king’s	garden	on	the	banks	of	the	river	Kaveri.	The
king	was	sitting	there,	relaxing	with	his	queens.	Sadashiva	Brahmendra	wandered	into	the
garden,	unaware	of	his	own	nakedness.	The	king	was	furious.	“Who	is	this	fool	that	dares	to
walk	naked	in	front	of	my	women?”

He	sent	his	soldiers	after	him.	The	soldiers	ran	behind	Sadashiva	Brahmendra,	calling	out
to	him.	He	did	not	turn	back.	He	continued	to	walk.	Angered,	one	of	the	soldiers	took	out	his
sword	and	struck	him,	severing	his	right	arm.	Sadashiva	Brahmendra	did	not	even	break	his
stride.	He	continued	walking.

Seeing	this,	the	soldiers	were	wonderstruck	and	terrified.	They	realized	that	this	was	no
ordinary	man.	The	king	and	his	soldiers	ran	after	him,	prostrated,	begged	his	forgiveness,
and	brought	him	back	to	the	garden.	He	lived	in	that	garden	for	the	rest	of	his	life,	and	finally
shed	his	body	there.

There	are	innumerable	instances	like	this	in	the	yogic	tradition.	When	your	energies	are	in
a	heightened	condition,	the	sense	of	the	physical	is	so	diminished	that	it	is	even	possible	to	go
without	any	external	nourishment	for	days	on	end.

What	exactly	is	the	role	of	the	chakras	within	the	system?
There	are	seven	fundamental	chakras:	the	 _muladhara,_ 	which	is	located	at	the	perineum,	the
space	between	the	anal	outlet	and	the	genital	organ;	 _swadhishthana,_ 	which	is	just	above	the
genital	organ;	 _manipuraka,_ 	which	is	three	fourths	of	an	inch	below	the	navel;	 _anahata,_ 	which
is	below	the	point	where	the	rib	cage	meets	the	diaphragm;	 _vishuddhi,_ 	which	is	at	the	pit	of	the
throat;	 _agna,_ 	which	is	between	the	eyebrows;	and	 _sahasrara,_ 	also	known	as	the	 _brahmarandra,_
which	is	at	the	fontanel	on	top	of	the	head	(where	newborn	infants	have	a	soft	spot).

The	 chakras	 are	 the	 seven	 different	 dimensions	 through	 which	 your	 energies	 find
expression.	Experiences	that	happen	within	you—anger,	misery,	peace,	joy,	and	ecstasy—are


different	 levels	 of	 expression	 of	 your	 life	 energies.	 If	 your	 energies	 are	 dominant	 in
muladhara,	 then	 food	 and	 sleep	 will	 be	 the	 most	 dominant	 factors	 in	 your	 life.	 If	 your
energies	are	dominant	in	swadhishthana,	pleasure	will	be	most	dominant	in	your	life;	this
means	 you	 enjoy	 your	 physical	 reality	 in	 many	 ways.	 If	 your	 energies	 are	 dominant	 in
manipuraka,	you	are	a	doer;	you	can	accomplish	many	things	in	the	world.	If	your	energies
are	dominant	in	anahata,	you	are	a	very	creative	person.	If	your	energies	are	dominant	in
vishuddhi,	you	will	develop	a	powerful	presence.	If	your	energies	are	dominant	in	agna,	then
you	are	intellectually	realized.	Intellectual	realization	can	bring	you	to	a	certain	state	of	peace
and	stability	within	yourself,	irrespective	of	what	is	happening	outside	of	you.

These	are	just	different	levels	of	intensity.	A	pleasure-seeker	has	more	intensity	to	his	life
than	someone	whose	life	is	just	food	and	sleep.	The	man	who	wants	to	initiate	something	in
the	world	has	much	more	intensity	than	a	pleasure-seeker.	An	artist	or	a	creative	person	lives
his	life	more	intensely	compared	to	these	three	people.	If	you	move	into	vishuddhi,	it	is	a
completely	different	dimension	of	intensity	and	agna	is	higher	still.	If	you	hit	your	sahasrara,
you	will	explode	into	unexplained	ecstasies.	Without	any	external	stimulant	or	reason,	you	are
simply	ecstatic	because	your	energies	have	touched	a	certain	peak.

It	is	misleading	to	speak	of	lower	and	higher	chakras.	It	is	like	comparing	the	foundation	of
the	building	to	the	roof.	The	roof	is	not	superior;	the	foundation	is	not	inferior.	The	quality,
life	span,	stability,	and	security	of	a	building	depend,	to	a	large	extent,	more	on	the	foundation
than	on	the	roof.	For	example,	in	the	physical	body,	your	energies	need	to	be	in	the	 _muladhara_
chakra	to	some	extent.	“Mula”	means	the	root	or	source,	and	“adhara”	means	foundation.	In
the	engineering	of	the	body,	this	is	the	base.	If	you	wish	to	grow,	you	need	to	cultivate	this.

At	the	same	time,	chakras	have	a	spiritual	dimension,	not	just	a	physical	one.	If	you	bring
the	right	amount	of	awareness	to	it,	the	same	muladhara	can	be	transformed	to	a	point	where
you	become	absolutely	free	of	the	compulsive	need	for	food	and	sleep.

The	 chakras	 fall	 into	 one	 of	 two	 different	 dimensions:	 the	 muladhara,	 swadhishthana,
manipuraka,	and	related	chakras	are	more	concerned	with	keeping	the	body	stable	and	rooted.
These	are	qualities	associated	with	the	earth,	with	self-preservation.	When	your	energies	are
dominant	in	these	chakras,	your	qualities	are	earthy	and	you	are	more	in	the	grip	of	nature.
The	 upper	 chakras—the	 vishuddhi,	 agna,	 sahasrara,	 and	 related	 chakras—are	 centers	 that
draw	 you	 away	 from	 the	 pull	 of	 the	 earth.	 They	 are	 concerned	 with	 the	 longing	 for	 the
infinite.	They	make	you	receptive	to	a	force	that	we	customarily	refer	to	as	grace.

The	middle	chakra,	anahata,	is	a	balance	between	the	two.	It	is	like	a	transition	between	your
lower	and	upper	chakras,	between	survival	instincts	and	the	instinct	toward	liberation.	It	is
symbolized	 by	 two	 interlocking	 triangles,	 one	 pointing	 downward	 and	 another	 upward,
forming	a	six-pointed	star.	Many	religious	traditions	have	used	the	star	as	a	sacred	symbol,
because	some	enlightened	beings	in	these	cultures	realized	their	original	nature	through	the
anahata,	and	discovered	the	interlocking	triangles	of	this	chakra	within	themselves.

The	 vishuddhi	 chakra,	 located	 in	 the	 pit	 of	 your	 throat,	 literally	 means	 “filter.”	 If	 your
vishuddhi	becomes	powerful,	you	have	the	ability	to	filter	everything	that	enters	you.	Or	in
other	words,	once	your	vishuddhi	is	very	active,	you	grow	so	powerful	that	external	nature


has	no	influence	over	you.	Indian	iconography	depicts	Adiyogi,	or	Shiva,	with	a	blue	throat,
because	he	is	capable	of	filtering	all	the	poisons	of	the	outside	world	and	preventing	them
from	entering	his	system	by	stalling	them	in	his	throat.

If	 your	 energies	 move	 into	 the	 agna	 chakra,	 located	 between	 your	 eyebrows,	 you	 are
intellectually	enlightened,	but	still	not	experientially	liberated.	The	great	mystic	philosopher
of	eighth-century	India	Adi	Shankara	walked	all	across	the	land,	defeating	legions	of	scholars
in	 metaphysical	 debate.	 His	 logic	 was	 unbeatable,	 because	 the	 union	 experienced	 in	 agna
endows	one	with	an	extraordinary	level	of	intellectual	insight	and	perception.

The	seventh	chakra,	sahasrara,	is	actually	located	just	outside	the	body.	For	most	people,	it
is	dormant.	Through	spiritual	practice	or	a	very	intense	way	of	living,	you	can	activate	this.	If
you	hit	your	sahasrara,	your	experience	is	no	longer	intellectual;	it	is	experiential.	You	now
explode	 into	 unexplained	 ecstasies	 and	 the	 deepest	 mystical	 realms	 start	 opening	 up.
Sometimes	 you	 can	 attain	 ecstasies	 that	 can	 turn	 uncontrollable,	 if	 there	 is	 not	 sufficient
spiritual	 practice	 to	 create	 the	 necessary	 physiological	 and	 psychological	 balance.	 In	 the
Indian	 tradition,	 these	 ecstatic	 mystics	 were	 termed	 _avadhutas_ .	 They	 were	 in	 such	 altered
states	of	consciousness	that	they	often	had	to	be	fed	and	taken	care	of	by	those	around	them
because	they	were	incapable	of	handling	the	worldly	aspects	of	life	on	their	own.

Fundamentally,	any	spiritual	path	can	be	described	as	the	journey	from	the	muladhara	to	the
sahasrara,	an	evolution	from	one	dimension	to	another.	There	is	a	wide	spectrum	of	spiritual
practices	in	the	yogic	system	that	enables	one	to	move	one’s	energies	from	one	chakra	to
another.	However,	from	the	agna	to	the	sahasrara,	there	is	no	path.	You	have	either	to	leap	or
fall	into	it.

This	is	one	of	the	reasons	for	the	tremendous	emphasis	on	the	guru	in	the	Indian	spiritual
tradition.	To	make	the	leap	from	the	agna	to	the	sahasrara	takes	immense	trust.	Suppose	you
were	confronted	by	a	bottomless	abyss,	and	someone	asked	you	to	plunge	into	it,	you	would
either	have	to	be	utterly	crazy,	extraordinarily	courageous,	or	absolutely	trusting	to	do	it.
Almost	no	one	has	the	kind	of	courage	it	takes.	Very	few	are	mad	enough	to	live	their	lives
with	total	abandon;	most	people	live	with	caution	and	the	overriding	need	to	protect	their
boundaries.	So,	for	99.9	percent	of	the	people,	what	is	needed	is	trust.	Without	trust,	they	will
never	make	the	leap.

However,	the	abyss	need	not	conjure	dark	images	of	a	terrifying	pit.	Instead,	it	signifies	a
space	free	of	all	possibility	of	hurt	and	suffering,	an	entirely	new	dimension	that	is	flawlessly
non-repetitive,	 a	 dimension	 beyond	 comparison	 and	 context	 that	 leaves	 you	 not	 as	 an
individual	but	as	all-encompassing	infinite	nature,	in	a	stillness	beyond	bliss.

And	so,	the	leap	is	worth	it.	The	leap	is	everything.	With	the	leap,	the	bottomless	abyss
becomes	boundless	freedom.

Sadhana


By	focusing	at	a	point	six	to	nine	inches	away	from	the	region	between	your	eyebrows	for	twelve	to	forty-
eight	minutes,	with	your	eyes	open,	you	can	realize	the	nature	and	structure	of	your	individual	chakras
(depending	on	the	duration	and	your	level	of	focus).	This	perception	can	help	in	stabilizing	the	random
movement	of	chakras	in	the	human	physiology	due	to	stressful	external	situations.	This	is	just	one	aspect	of
a	 very	 sophisticated	 form	 of	 kriya	 yoga	 that	 allows	 you	 access	 to	 your	 inner	 akashic,	 or	 etheric,
dimension.


```
UNCHARTED	PATH
```
The	sixth	limb	of	yoga	is	referred	to	as	 _dhyana,_ 	or	 _dhyan,_ 	which	is	essentially
about	transcending	the	boundaries	of	one’s	physical	and	mental	framework.
Dhyan	traveled	from	India	to	China	along	with	the	Buddhist	monks,	where	it
was	 referred	 to	 as	 _Ch’an_ .	 This	 yoga	 traveled	 through	 the	 Southeast	 Asian
countries	to	Japan	and	became	 _Zen,_ 	and	found	expression	as	a	whole	system	of
direct	insight	without	an	emphasis	on	doctrine.	Zen	is	a	spiritual	path	that	has
no	scriptures,	books,	rules,	or	rigid	practices;	it	is	an	uncharted	path.

The	 first	 recorded	 use	 of	 the	 method	 we	 now	 call	 Zen	 happened	 almost
eight	thousand	years	ago,	well	before	the	time	of	Gautama	the	Buddha.	King
Janaka	 was	 a	 brilliant	 man	 and	 ardent	 seeker,	 burning	 with	 the	 longing	 to
know.	He	had	exhausted	all	the	spiritual	teachers	in	the	kingdom.	None	of	them
could	help	him	because	they	were	all	born	out	of	the	book.	He	had	still	to	meet
someone	who	came	from	inner	experience.

One	day	the	king	went	on	a	hunting	trip.	Riding	deep	into	the	jungle,	he
caught	 sight	 of	 a	 yogi.	 He	 stopped.	 Seated	 outside	 a	 small	 hermitage	 was
Ashtavakra,	one	of	the	most	accomplished	yogis	and	spiritual	masters	of	all
time.	Janaka	prepared	to	get	off	the	horse	to	greet	him.	He	swung	his	leg	over
the	saddle	and	was	about	to	dismount	when	Ashtavakra	said,	“Stop!”

So,	 Janaka	 stopped	 right	 there,	 one	 leg	 still	 in	 the	 stirrup	 and	 the	 other
midair.	It	was	a	painful	position	to	be	in,	but	Janaka	stayed	frozen,	staring	at
Ashtavakra.	We	don’t	know	how	long	the	guru	held	him	that	way,	but	suddenly
in	that	awkward	state,	Janaka	became	fully	enlightened.	The	method	employed
by	Ashtavakra	was	akin	to	what	is	generally	known	in	the	world	as	Zen	today.

Once	it	happened...There	was	a	Zen	master	whom	everyone	respected,	but
who	 had	 no	 teaching	 to	 impart.	 He	 always	 carried	 a	 huge	 sack	 on	 his
shoulders;	this	would	contain	many	items,	and	some	of	it	would	be	sweets.	In
every	town	and	village	that	he	visited,	children	would	gather	around	him,	and
he	would	distribute	sweets	and	leave.	People	asked	for	teachings,	but	he	would
just	laugh	and	go	on	his	way.

One	day,	a	man	who	was	himself	known	to	be	a	Zen	master	of	great	repute,
came	to	meet	him.	He	wanted	to	ascertain	whether	this	man	with	a	sack	was
really	in	Zen	or	not.	So	he	asked	him,	“What	is	Zen?”	Immediately,	the	man
dropped	the	sack	and	stood	straight.

```
Then	he	asked,	“What	is	the	goal	of	Zen?”	The	man	picked	up	the	sack,
```

slung	it	over	his	shoulders,	and	walked	away.

This	 is	 what	 yoga	 is	 also	 about.	 This	 is	 what	 every	 spiritual	 practice	 is
about.	 When	 you	 want	 to	 attain	 yoga	 or	 Zen,	 you	 have	 to	 drop	 your	 load,
discard	everything	on	the	way,	remain	free,	stand	upright.	It	is	important.	With
your	load,	you	may	never	do	it.	And	what	is	the	goal	of	yoga?	Consciously
take	on	the	whole	load	once	again.	And	now	it	no	longer	feels	like	a	load!


**Sacred	Science**

What	does	it	mean	to	sanctify	or	consecrate	a	space?

The	word	“consecration”	is	often	used	somewhat	loosely.	For	most	people,	it	denotes	a
series	of	rituals	that	offers,	at	best,	beauty	and	poetry	to	our	lives,	but	performs	no	real	useful
function.	Most	believe	it	is	mere	mumbo	jumbo	meant	to	obfuscate	the	spiritual	process	and
exploit	a	fearful	and	gullible	majority.	It	is	time	to	discard	this	superficial	understanding	and
look	deeper.

If	you	transform	mud	into	food,	we	call	this	agriculture.	If	you	make	food	into	flesh	and
bone,	we	call	this	digestion.	If	you	make	flesh	into	mud,	we	call	this	cremation.	If	you	make
this	flesh,	or	even	a	stone	or	empty	space,	into	a	higher	possibility,	this	is	consecration.

Consecration	is	a	live	process.	The	Sanskrit	word	for	it	is	 _pratishtha._ 	As	we	have	discussed
earlier,	modern	science	today	tells	us	that	everything	is	the	same	energy	manifesting	itself	in	a
million	different	ways.	If	that	is	so,	what	you	call	the	divine,	what	you	call	a	stone,	what	you
call	a	man	or	a	woman,	or	a	demon,	are	all	the	same	energy	functioning	in	different	ways.	If
you	have	the	necessary	technology,	you	can	make	the	simple	space	around	you	into	a	divine
exuberance.	You	can	just	take	a	piece	of	rock	and	make	it	into	a	god	or	a	goddess.	This	is	the
phenomenon	of	consecration.

An	 enormous	 amount	 of	 knowledge	 about	 consecration	 has	 been	 perpetuated	 across
generations	since	ancient	times,	particularly	in	India.	This	is	because	regardless	of	how	good
your	life	is,	or	how	long	you	live,	at	some	point	the	fundamental	human	longing	to	get	in
touch	with	the	source	of	creation	will	invariably	assert	itself.	If	the	possibility	to	access	these
deeper	 dimensions	 is	 not	 created	 and	 made	 available	 to	 every	 individual	 who	 seeks,	 then
society	has	failed	to	provide	authentic	well-being	for	its	citizens.

It	 is	 because	 of	 this	 awareness	 that	 the	 Indian	 culture	 built	 numerous	 temples	 on	 every
street.	The	idea	was	not	to	create	temples	that	were	in	competition	with	one	another.	The	idea
was	simply	that	no	one	should	live	in	a	space	that	is	not	consecrated.

It	is	tremendous	good	fortune	for	a	human	being	to	live	in	a	consecrated	space.	When	you
do,	the	very	way	you	live	becomes	distinctly	different.	You	may	ask,	“Can’t	I	live	without	it?”
You	can.	If	you	know	how	to	make	your	very	body	into	a	temple,	going	to	the	temple	is	not	so
significant.	Yes,	you	can	consecrate	your	own	body.	But	the	question	is,	are	you	able	to	keep	it
that	way?

All	spiritual	initiations	have	been	aimed	at	consecrating	this	very	flesh	into	a	temple-like
space.	After	that,	all	that	is	needed	is	maintenance.	Doing	a	spiritual	practice	every	day	is	one
way	of	trying	to	maintain	the	human	system	in	a	high	state	of	vibrancy	after	an	initiation.	I
have	 given	 powerful	 consecrations	 to	 people	 at	 various	 times,	 sometimes	 formally,


sometimes	 informally.	 To	 consecrate	 an	 inanimate	 object—a	 rock,	 for	 example—costs	 an
enormous	 amount	 of	 life.	 Making	 human	 beings	 into	 living	 temples	 is	 much	 more
inexpensive	and	eco-friendly—and	besides,	they	are	mobile!	There	are	many	advantages,	but
the	problem	is	human	beings	have	to	dedicate	a	certain	amount	of	time,	energy,	and	focus	to
maintenance,	otherwise	it	will	not	work.

When	people	in	the	world	are	too	distracted	and	unwilling	to	make	themselves	into	living
temples,	building	stone	temples	becomes	a	necessity.	The	basic	purpose	of	building	a	temple
is	to	benefit	the	majority	of	people	who	have	no	spiritual	practice	in	their	lives.	If	one	can	do
some	spiritual	practice	in	such	a	consecrated	space,	it	is	doubly	beneficial.	Particularly	for
those	 who	 do	 not	 know	 how	 to	 make	 their	 own	 body	 into	 a	 temple,	 the	 outer	 temple	 is
invaluable.

Consecration,	 or	 pratishtha,	 is	 done	 in	 various	 ways,	 but	 generally	 by	 using	 rituals,
mantras,	sounds,	forms,	and	various	other	ingredients.	Constant	maintenance	is	required.	The
rituals	in	the	temples	are	not	for	your	sake;	they	are	to	keep	the	deity	or	energy	form	alive.
What	is	a	deity?	A	deity	is	a	tool	for	a	specific	purpose:	to	achieve	fulfillment	in	different
aspects	of	life.	In	fact,	the	traditional	word	for	deity	is	 _yantra,_ 	which	literally	translates	as
machine	or	a	working	energy	form.	Traditional	wisdom	has	always	advised	people	against
keeping	stone	idols	at	home.	If	you	keep	them,	you	must	maintain	them	every	day	with	the
right	 kind	 of	 processes.	 If	 a	 deity	 is	 consecrated	 through	 mantras,	 and	 if	 the	 necessary
maintenance	does	not	happen	on	a	daily	basis,	the	deity	becomes	a	withdrawing	energy	and
can	cause	immense	harm	to	people	who	live	in	the	vicinity.	Unfortunately,	many	temples	have
become	like	this	because	of	improper	maintenance	by	people	who	do	not	know	how	to	keep
them	alive.

_Prana	pratishtha_ 	is	different	in	that	it	uses	your	own	life	energies	to	consecrate	something.
When	you	consecrate	a	form	in	this	way,	it	does	not	need	any	maintenance.	It	is	quite	literally
forever.	When	I	fulfilled	my	life	mission,	which	was	the	consecration	of	the	Dhyanalinga	(a
subtle	 energy	 form	 with	 all	 chakras	 operating	 at	 their	 optimal	 capacity,	 at	 the	 Isha	 Yoga
Center	in	Coimbatore,	in	southern	India,	in	1999),	it	was	through	prana	pratishtha.	This	is	why
there	are	no	rituals	in	this	shrine.	None	are	required.	The	Dhyanalinga	does	not	need	any
maintenance	because	its	vibrancy	will	never	fluctuate.	Even	if	you	take	away	the	stone	part	of
the	structure _,_ 	it	will	remain	the	same.	Irrespective	of	physical	changes	that	may	happen	over
time,	the	energy	form	will	not	perish!	This	is	because	the	real	form	is	made	of	a	non-physical
dimension.	It	is	indestructible.

The	Indian	temples	were	never	places	of	prayer.	The	tradition	was	that	you	had	a	shower
first	thing	in	the	morning	and	went	directly	to	the	temple,	sat	there	for	a	while,	and	only	then
began	 your	 day.	 The	 temple	 was	 like	 a	 public	 battery-charging	 space.	 Most	 people	 have
forgotten	 this	 nowadays.	 They	 just	 go	 to	 temples,	 ask	 for	 something,	 bum-bounce	 on	 the
temple	floor,	and	then	leave.	This	is	quite	pointless.	The	idea	is	to	sit	and	imbibe	the	energies
of	the	place.

At	 the	 Dhyanalinga	 Yogic	 Temple	 in	 Coimbatore,	 you	 are	 not	 required	 to	 “believe”	 in
anything	to	reap	its	benefits.	You	are	not	required	to	pray,	or	make	any	ritual	offering.	You


are	encouraged	to	just	close	your	eyes	and	be	in	the	space	for	some	time.	If	you	were	to	try	it
for	yourself,	you	would	discover	that	it	is	a	tremendous	experience.	The	Dhyanalinga	is	in	the
highest	level	of	intensity	that	any	form	can	be.	Even	if	those	who	do	not	know	anything	about
meditation	come	and	sit	there,	they	become	meditative	by	their	own	nature.	That	is	the	kind	of
remarkable	tool	it	is.

If	I	were	given	the	necessary	support	and	opportunity,	I	would	like	to	consecrate	the	whole
planet!	This	is	what	I	am	good	at:	turning	thin	air	into	a	very	powerful	vibrant	space,	turning	a
piece	 of	 metal	 or	 stone	 into	 a	 divine	 reverberation.	 It	 is	 my	 dream	 that	 someday	 all	 of
humanity	should	live	in	a	consecrated	environment.	Your	home	should	be	consecrated;	your
street	should	be	consecrated;	your	office	should	be	consecrated.	All	the	places	where	you
spend	your	time	should	be	consecrated.	When	you	live	in	such	a	space,	your	evolution	need
not	stick	to	the	Darwinian	scale;	you	can	simply	leapfrog	ahead	to	a	state	of	ultimate	well-
being	and	freedom.

In	 India,	 most	 ancient	 temples	 were	 built	 for	 Shiva,	 or	 “that	 which	 is	 not.”	 There	 are
thousands	of	Shiva	temples	in	the	country,	and	most	of	them	do	not	have	any	idol	as	such.
They	generally	have	a	representative	form,	a	 _linga_.

The	 word	 “linga”	 means	 “the	 form.”	 When	 creation	 began	 to	 happen,	 or	 when	 the
unmanifest	became	manifest,	the	first	form	that	it	assumed	was	that	of	an	ellipsoid,	or	a	three-
dimensional	ellipse,	which	is	what	we	call	a	linga.	It	started	as	an	ellipsoid,	and	then	took	on
many	other	shapes	and	forms.	If	you	go	into	deep	states	of	meditativeness,	you	will	find	that
before	a	point	of	absolute	dissolution,	once	again	the	energy	takes	on	the	form	of	a	linga.
Modern	cosmologists	have	identified	that	the	core	of	every	galaxy	is	always	an	ellipsoid.

So,	generally	in	yoga,	the	linga	is	considered	to	be	the	perfect	and	fundamental	form	in
existence.	It	is	the	first	form	and	the	final	form.	In	the	space	between,	creation	takes	place.
What	lies	beyond	is	“that	which	is	not”	or	shi-va.	So,	the	linga	form	is	actually	an	opening	in
the	fabric	of	creation.	For	physical	creation,	the	front	door	is	a	linga	and	the	back	door	is	a
linga!	This	makes	the	temple	an	opening	in	the	fabric	of	the	physical.	You	could	fall	right
through	it	and	go	beyond:	that	is	what	makes	it	such	a	tremendous	possibility.

Interestingly,	lingas	are	found	all	over	the	world.	In	Africa,	there	are	terra-cotta	lingas,
largely	used	for	occult	purposes.	In	Delphi,	Greece,	there	is	a	linga	below	the	ground,	known
as	the	“navel	of	the	earth.”	This	is	purely	a	manipura	linga,	meant	to	promote	prosperity	and
material	well-being.	When	someone	showed	me	a	picture	of	it,	I	immediately	knew	what	type
of	people	had	consecrated	this.	It	was	definitely	done	by	Indian	yogis	thousands	of	years	ago;
there	is	no	doubt	about	that.

When	I	consecrated	Adiyogi:	The	Abode	of	Yoga	in	Tennessee	in	the	year	2015,	it	was	an
event	of	considerable	spiritual	import—in	fact,	a	milestone	for	classical	yoga	in	the	Western
world.	Having	seen	various	ancient	sites	of	interest,	I	am	quite	certain	nothing	of	this	kind	of
energetic	significance	has	happened	in	North	America,	or	indeed	in	the	western	hemisphere	in
the	last	three	thousand	years.	Consecrated	through	the	process	of	prana	pratishtha,	the	space	is
a	tribute	to	Adiyogi,	the	world’s	first	yogi.	Exclusively	dedicated	to	the	pursuit	and	practice	of
yoga,	the	space	represents	a	living	repository	of	the	highest	level	of	energetic	vibrancy	and


exuberance,	and	offers	a	unique	spiritual	possibility	to	seekers	in	the	West.

Most	of	the	lingas	in	India	right	now	represent	one	chakra	or	two	at	the	most.	They	are
invariably	consecrated	for	material	well-being.	There	are	some	anahata	lingas	consecrated	to
promote	peace	and	joy	as	well.	The	uniqueness	of	the	Dhyanalinga	is	that	it	has	all	seven
chakras	energized	at	their	peak.	To	create	seven	separate	lingas	for	seven	chakras	would	have
been	so	much	easier,	but	the	impact	would	not	have	been	the	same.	So,	the	Dhyanalinga	is	like
the	 energy	 body	 of	 the	 most	 evolved	 being,	 referred	 to	 in	 the	 yogic	 culture	 as	 “Shiva,”
eternally	available	to	all.	It	is	the	highest	possible	manifestation.

If	you	push	energy	up	to	very	high	levels	of	intensity,	it	can	hold	form	only	until	a	certain
point.	Beyond	that,	it	becomes	formless	and	people	are	largely	incapable	of	experiencing	it.
The	Dhyanalinga	has	been	consecrated	in	such	a	way	that	the	energy	has	been	crystallized	at
the	highest	point	beyond	which	there	can	be	no	form.	It	was	created	so	that	the	intimacy	of
sitting	with	a	live	guru	is	available	to	every	seeker	who	longs	for	it.

Above	all,	what	makes	the	Dhyanalinga	an	immense	and	unprecedented	spiritual	possibility
is	the	fact	that	it	represents	the	opportunity	to	experience	life	in	its	complete	depth	and	totality.
One	who	comes	into	its	sphere	is	influenced	on	the	level	of	the	akashic,	or	etheric	body,	or
the	 vignanamayakosha.	 If	 you	 bring	 about	 a	 certain	 transformation	 through	 the	 physical,
mental,	or	energy	body,	it	can	be	lost	in	the	course	of	life.	But	once	you	are	touched	on	the
level	of	the	etheric	body,	it	is	forever.	Even	if	you	go	through	many	lifetimes,	this	seed	of
liberation	will	wait	for	the	right	opportunity	to	sprout	and	flower.

It	took	me	three	and	a	half	years	of	a	very	intense	process	of	consecration	to	complete	the
Dhyanalinga.	Many	yogis	and	adepts	have	attempted	to	create	such	a	linga,	but	for	various
reasons,	all	the	required	ingredients	never	came	together.	This	was	not	my	will;	it	was	my
guru’s.	 Though	 my	 contact	 with	 my	 master	 was	 momentary,	 it	 has	 in	 every	 way	 been
momentous.	It	has	directed	every	step	of	my	life,	including	my	very	birth.	The	Dhyanalinga
has	finally	been	accomplished,	with	his	grace	and	with	the	love,	support,	and	understanding	of
many	people,	who	gave	of	themselves,	knowingly	or	unknowingly,	willingly	or	unwillingly,
consciously	or	unconsciously.	I	am	grateful	to	them	all.

Sadhana

```
If	you	learn	how	to	use	the	five	elements	in	a	certain	simple	geometric	formation,	you	can	create	a	highly
beneficial	energy	space	for	yourself.	Here’s	a	simple	exercise	you	can	try.
Draw	a	figure	like	the	one	below	with	rice	flour	or	some	kind	of	grain.	Place	a	small	ghee,	or	clarified
butter,	lamp	in	a	plate	full	of	water	at	the	center.	Place	a	flower	in	the	water.	You	have	now	created	a
geometric	form,	using	water,	fire,	and	air.	The	flower	in	the	water	represents	the	earth.	Akash,	or	ether,	is,
of	course,	always	present.
Try	this	simple	process	every	evening.	You	will	find	the	energy	of	your	room	altered	in	a	subtle	but
powerful	way.	In	this	manner,	you	can	uniquely	empower	your	home	or	office	on	a	daily	basis.

**Mountains	of	Grace**

For	most	yogis	and	mystics,	the	problem	has	been	that	they	could	never	share	the	fruits	of
their	realization	with	people	around	them.	To	find	another	person	capable	of	receiving	what
you	know	is	not	easy.	If	you	find	even	one	person	you	are	fortunate.

So,	 most	 spiritual	 masters	 downloaded	 their	 knowing	 in	 remote	 but	 not	 entirely
inaccessible	places.	They	often	chose	mountain	peaks	because	there	is	less	human	traffic	and
disturbance	in	such	places.	There	are	many	wonderful	places	like	this	in	India.	Mount	Kailash
(the	mountain	peak	in	western	Tibet	that	is	regarded	as	a	sacred	place	of	immeasurable	power
and	antiquity)	is	the	place	where	the	maximum	amount	of	knowledge	has	been	stored	for	a
very	long	time	in	energy	form.

Kailash	is	the	greatest	mystical	library	on	the	planet.	Almost	all	the	religions	of	the	East
hold	it	as	highly	sacred.	Among	Hindus,	it	is	traditionally	regarded	as	the	abode	of	the	great
god	Shiva	and	his	consort,	Parvati.	The	Buddhists	hold	it	holy	because	three	of	their	great
Buddhas	are	believed	to	be	living	there.	The	Jains	believe	that	their	first	great	master,	or
_tirthankara_ ,	 attained	 liberation	 there.	 The	 Bon	 religion,	 which	 is	 the	 original	 religion	 of
Tibet,	also	considers	it	deeply	sacred.

I	have	been	taking	pilgrims	to	Kailash	for	the	past	eleven	years.	When	I	went	there	in	2007,
my	health	was	particularly	bad.	I	had	been	traveling	for	weeks	nonstop,	during	which	baffled
medics	in	different	parts	of	the	world	had	diagnosed	me	with	a	variety	of	illnesses,	including
malaria,	dengue,	typhoid,	and	even	cancer.	The	confounded	doctors	termed	my	blood	reports
“esoteric”!	Finally,	I	decided	to	look	inward	and	work	on	myself.	A	few	days	later,	I	went	to
Kailash.	I	was	better	at	this	point,	but	still	very	weak.	When	I	looked	at	the	mountain,	I	saw
there	was	so	much	mystical	knowledge	waiting	to	be	accessed.	So	I	took	a	strand	of	energy
from	the	mountain	and	connected	it	to	my	energy	system	in	a	certain	way.	As	soon	as	I	did
that,	there	was	a	sudden	resurgence	of	vitality,	and	my	depleted	energy	body	(ravaged	by
nearly	eight	weeks	of	fever)	bounced	back	to	normal.	I	looked	younger,	felt	younger,	and
even	my	voice	had	changed—just	in	about	an	hour’s	time!	The	results	were	visible.	There
were	almost	two	hundred	people	around	me	who	witnessed	this.

There	are	other	places	of	enormous	vibrational	energy	where	mystics	have	bequeathed	the
fruits	of	their	spiritual	practice.	Such	spaces	are	innumerable	in	the	Himalayas.	A	variety	of
mystics	and	yogis	chose	these	mountains	as	their	abode.	When	they	lived	there	they	naturally
left	behind	a	certain	dimension	of	energy,	and	as	a	result,	the	Himalayas	gathered	a	kind	of
aura.

For	example,	Kedarnath	is	just	a	small	temple	in	the	Himalayas.	There	is	no	deity	there;	it	is
just	an	outcrop	of	a	rock.	But	it	is	one	of	the	most	powerful	places	in	the	world!	If	you	strive
to	improve	your	receptivity	and	then	visit	a	place	like	that,	it	will	just	blow	you	away.	There


are	many	places	like	that	in	the	East,	but	the	Himalayas	attract	the	most	people.

There	is	another	place	called	Kumara	Parvat	in	the	South	Indian	state	of	Karnataka.	 _Parvat_
means	“mountain.”	 _Kumara_ 	refers	to	the	son	of	Shiva,	whose	name	was	Kartikeya.	He	fought
many	battles,	trying	to	transform	the	world,	but	when	he	realized	the	futility	of	this,	he	came
to	this	region.	It	is	here	that	he	washed	his	sword	of	its	blood	for	the	last	time.	He	decided	that
even	if	he	fought	for	a	thousand	years,	he	was	never	going	to	change	the	world;	that	one
violent	solution	would	breed	another	ten	problems.	So	he	climbed	up	the	mountain	and	stood
on	the	summit.	Normally	when	a	yogi	wants	to	shed	his	body,	he	will	either	sit	or	lie	down.
But	because	he	was	such	a	warrior,	Kartikeya	stood	up	and	exited	his	body,	standing.

If	one	can	exit	the	physical	form	voluntarily	without	damaging	it,	that	is	an	indication	of
absolute	mastery	over	the	life	process.	This	is	generally	referred	to	in	the	Indian	tradition	as
_mahasamadhi,_ 	or	“glorious	equanimity.”

When	I	went	to	Kumara	Parvat	many	years	ago,	a	small	tent	was	set	up	for	me.	I	wanted	to
sleep	in	it,	but	when	I	went	in	and	tried	to	lie	down,	my	body	would	involuntarily	move	into	a
standing	posture,	dismantling	the	tent.	The	whole	night	I	was	not	able	to	sit;	my	body	would
only	stand.	That	is	when	I	started	seeing	what	Kartikeya’s	life	was	all	about.	Although	he	lived
thousands	of	years	ago,	what	he	left	behind	is	still	vibrantly	alive.

This	kind	of	work	can	never	be	wiped	out.	Wherever	a	person	does	something	with	his	life
energies,	he	creates	a	certain	possibility	which	cannot	be	erased	by	any	event.	The	work	and
presence	of	anybody	who	experimented	even	a	little	bit	with	the	inner	dimensions	can	never
be	destroyed.

For	example,	Gautama	the	Buddha	is	supposed	to	have	lived	2,500	years	ago,	and	Jesus	is
supposed	to	have	lived	2,000	years	ago,	but	as	far	as	I	am	concerned,	both	are	a	living	reality.
Once	you	create	a	certain	volume	of	work	with	your	life	energies,	it	is	permanent	for	all
practical	purposes	and	time	does	not	destroy	it.	If	you	work	with	the	physical	body	of	flesh
and	blood,	it	has	a	limited	life	span.	If	you	use	your	mind,	the	life	span	of	that	work	is	much
longer.	But	if	you	work	with	your	fundamental	life	energies,	then	the	result	is	timeless.


```
THE	SILVER	PEAKS
```
Ever	 since	 my	 infancy,	 there	 was	 always	 a	 certain	 mountain	 peak	 in	 the
background	of	my	gaze.	Only	when	I	was	sixteen	years	old	and	discussed	this
with	my	friends	(who	responded,	“You’re	crazy!	Where	are	mountains?”)	did	I
realize	that	nobody	else	had	mountains	in	their	eyes!	For	some	time	I	thought	I
should	locate	that	peak,	but	then	I	put	the	idea	aside.

Suppose	there	were	a	spot	on	your	spectacles.	You’d	get	used	to	it	after	a
while.	It	was	just	like	that	with	my	mountain	peak.	It	was	only	much	later	when
a	flood	of	memory	returned	to	me,	and	when	I	was	looking	for	a	place	to
establish	 the	 Dhyanalinga,	 that	 I	 began	 to	 search	 for	 the	 peak	 that	 had
dominated	my	vision.

I	traveled	everywhere.	I	made	the	760-mile	ride	from	Goa	to	Kanyakumari
on	the	southernmost	tip	of	India	about	eleven	times.	Along	every	road	and
mud	track,	I	have	probably	ridden	thousands	of	miles.

Then	just	by	chance	one	day,	many	years	later,	I	came	upon	a	village	outside
Coimbatore.	 As	 I	 was	 driving	 round	 a	 bend,	 I	 saw	 the	 Seventh	 Hill	 of	 the
Velliangiri	 Mountains.	 There	 it	 was:	 the	 mountain	 that	 I	 had	 seen	 since	 my
childhood.	 The	 moment	 I	 set	 my	 eyes	 upon	 that	 peak—one	 that	 had	 lived
within	me	for	my	entire	life—it	vanished	from	my	inner	vision	and	became	a
living	reality.	Suddenly	I	knew	this	would	be	the	most	conducive	space	for	my
life	work.

If	you	ask	me,	“Which	is	the	greatest	mountain	on	the	planet?”	I	will	always
reply,	“Velliangiri.”	I	was	born	with	an	imprint	of	these	mountains	in	my	eyes
and	they	have	haunted	me	ever	since.	They	lived	within	me	and	have	been	my
very	own	navigating	system,	my	inner	radar.	These	mountains	aren’t	just	a
matter	of	geography	for	me.	They	are	a	reservoir	of	all	that	I	needed	to	know
to	create	the	Dhyanalinga.

The	word	“Velliangiri”	literally	means	“silver	mountain,”	and	this	range	is
so	named	because	these	mountains	are	covered	with	cloud	for	a	large	part	of
the	year.	They	are	also	known	as	the	“Kailash	of	the	South”	because	Adiyogi,
or	Shiva	himself,	spent	a	little	over	three	months	upon	these	mountain	peaks.
When	 he	 came	 here,	 he	 was	 not	 in	 his	 usual	 blissful	 mood.	 (According	 to
legend,	he	was	angry	with	himself	because	he	had	failed	to	keep	his	word	to
one	of	his	most	ardent	woman	devotees.)	He	was	intense	and	despondent,	and
that	energy	is	still	evident	today;	it	produced	a	string	of	yogis	through	the


tradition	who	were	of	the	angry	sort.	They	did	their	spiritual	practice	here	and
acquired	that	quality.	They	were	not	angry	about	anything	in	particular;	they
were	simply	in	a	certain	state	of	intensity.

Above	all,	this	mountain	is	very	important	for	me	because	this	is	where	my
guru	left	his	body.	This	mountain	is	like	a	temple,	a	living	shrine,	for	us	in	this
yogic	tradition—a	torrent	of	divinity,	a	cascade	of	grace.


**The	Way	of	the	Mystic**

There	is	a	great	curiosity	in	certain	circles	about	mystical	experiences.	Many	claim	to	have
had	 extraordinary	 paranormal	 experiences	 which	 they	 cite	 as	 proof	 of	 their	 spiritual
evolution.

A	common	word	in	people’s	spiritual	lexicons	nowadays	is	 _samadhi,_ 	which	is	seen	as	a
certificate	of	mystical	attainment.

What	is	samadhi?
It	is	a	certain	state	of	equanimity	in	which	the	intellect	goes	beyond	its	normal	function	of
discrimination.	This,	in	turn,	loosens	one	from	one’s	physical	body	such	that	there	is	a	space
between	you	and	your	body.

There	 are	 various	 types	 of	 samadhis,	 which	 for	 the	 sake	 of	 understanding,	 have	 been
classified	 into	 eight	 types.	 Among	 these	 eight	 there	 are	 two	 broad	 categories:	 _savikalpa_
(samadhis	 with	 attributes	 or	 qualities	 that	 are	 very	 pleasant,	 blissful,	 and	 ecstatic);	 and
_nirvikalpa_ 	(samadhis	that	are	beyond	pleasant	and	unpleasant,	without	attributes	or	qualities).
In	the	case	of	nirvikalpa	samadhi,	there	is	only	a	single-pointed	contact	with	the	body.	The	rest
of	 the	 energy	 is	 loose	 and	 uninvolved	 with	 the	 physical.	 These	 states	 are	 maintained	 for
certain	 periods	 to	 help	 practitioners	 establish	 the	 distinction	 between	 themselves	 and	 their
bodies.

Samadhi	 is	 a	 significant	 step	 in	 one’s	 spiritual	 evolution,	 but	 it	 is	 still	 not	 the	 ultimate.
Experiencing	a	certain	type	of	samadhi	does	not	mean	you	are	released	from	the	cycles	of
existence.	It	is	just	a	new	level	of	experience.	When	you	were	a	child,	you	experienced	life	in
a	particular	way.	When	you	move	into	your	adulthood,	you	have	another	level	of	experience.
You	 experience	 the	 same	 things	 in	 a	 totally	 different	 way	 at	 different	 points	 in	 your	 life.
Samadhis	are	just	like	this.

Some	people	may	go	into	a	certain	level	of	samadhi	and	stay	there	for	years	because	it	is
enjoyable.	In	this	condition,	there	is	no	space	or	time	and	no	bodily	problems	because	the
physical	 and	 psychological	 barriers	 have	 been	 broken	 to	 some	 extent.	 But	 this	 is	 only
temporary.	The	moment	they	come	out	of	this	state,	all	the	bodily	needs	and	mental	habits
return	once	again.

Generally,	 compared	 to	 someone	 who	 is	 sober,	 someone	 who	 is	 slightly	 drunk	 has	 a
different	level	of	experience	and	exuberance.	But	everyone	still	has	to	come	down	at	some
point.	All	samadhis	are	a	way	of	getting	high	without	any	external	chemicals.	If	you	go	into
these	states,	a	new	dimension	does	open	up	for	you.	But	the	crucial	thing	is	that	it	does	not
leave	you	permanently	transformed.	You	have	not	moved	into	another	reality.	Your	level	of
experience	has	deepened,	but	you	have	not	become	free,	in	an	ultimate	sense.


Most	 enlightened	 beings	 never	 stayed	 in	 samadhi	 states.	 Gautama	 Buddha	 never	 sat	 and
meditated	for	years	on	end	after	his	enlightenment.	Many	of	his	disciples	went	into	very	long
meditations	for	years.	But	Gautama	himself	never	did	this	because	he	must	have	seen	it	was
not	necessary	for	him.	He	practiced	and	experienced	all	the	eight	kinds	of	samadhis	before	his
enlightenment,	and	he	discarded	them.	He	said,	“This	is	not	it.”	He	knew	this	was	not	going	to
take	him	to	realization.	Samadhi	is	just	a	heightened	level	of	experience,	a	kind	of	inner	LSD
without	any	external	input,	which	causes	altered	levels	of	perception.	The	risk	is	that	you
could	get	caught	up	with	it,	because	it	is	far	more	beautiful	than	the	current	reality,	but	even
the	most	beautiful	experiences,	as	we	know,	can	become	a	drag	with	time.

If	you	have	made	realization	the	top	priority	in	your	life,	then	anything	that	does	not	take
you	 one	 step	 closer	 toward	 your	 ultimate	 freedom	 is	 meaningless.	 Let	 us	 say	 you	 are
climbing	Mount	Everest:	you	will	not	take	one	step	sideways	because	every	iota	of	energy	is
needed	to	reach	the	peak.	Now	if	you	have	to	reach	the	peak	of	your	consciousness,	you	need
every	iota	of	energy	you	can	muster.	And	still	it	is	not	enough!	Now,	you	would	not	want	to
perform	any	action	that	would	distract	you	from	the	main	purpose.

What	is	this	self-realization?	you	might	wonder.	After	all,	all	that	most	people	are	looking
for	is	health,	well-being,	wealth,	love,	and	success.	Do	you	really	need	self-realization?

Let	us	look	at	this	in	the	simplest	possible	way.	Isn’t	it	true	that	the	more	you	know	about
your	 computer,	 the	 better	 you	 can	 use	 it?	 Isn’t	 it	 true	 that	 your	 ability	 to	 use	 a	 device	 or
instrument	is	directly	proportional	to	your	knowledge	about	it?	Isn’t	it	true	that	someone	with
a	 high	 level	 of	 dexterity	 and	 expertise	 can	 use	 even	 a	 simple	 instrument	 in	 a	 seemingly
magical	way?	Have	you	seen	some	people	riding	on	a	piece	of	plastic	they	call	a	surfboard,
doing	incredible	things?	Just	a	piece	of	plastic,	and	what	amazing	feats	of	agility	and	grace
they	can	perform!

Similarly,	the	more	profound	your	understanding	of	the	human	mechanism	is,	the	more
magical	 your	 life	 will	 be.	 In	 every	 culture,	 there	 have	 been	 a	 few	 people	 who	 performed
certain	 actions	 that	 made	 others	 believe	 in	 miracles.	 All	 these	 actions	 that	 are	 known	 as
miracles	are	just	born	of	a	more	profound	access	to	life	that	some	have	enjoyed.	That	access,
as	I	have	said	time	and	again,	is	available	to	everyone	who	cares	to	look	deeper.


**Tantra:	A	Technology**

**for	Transformation**

Today,	there	are	many	practices	associated	with	the	occult	sciences	masquerading	as	spiritual
processes.

Let	us	say	I	am	in	India	and	you	are	in	America.	I	want	to	send	you	a	flower,	but	I	am	not
willing	to	take	the	journey	that	Columbus	took.	If	I	make	this	flower	suddenly	land	in	your
lap,	this	is	occult.	There	is	 _nothing_ 	spiritual	about	it;	it	is	just	another	way	of	handling	the
physical	dimension	of	life.

In	India,	we	have	many	sophisticated	occult	processes.	There	are	people	who	can	just	look
at	a	photograph	and	make	or	break	a	person’s	life.	They	could	ensure	that	the	person	contracts
some	ailment	that	the	body	could	not	customarily	have	acquired	in	such	a	short	span	of	time.
These	occult	practitioners	can	also	create	health,	but	unfortunately	many	of	them	use	their
ability	in	other	ways,	as	there	seems	to	be	a	better	market	for	these	negative	talents.	In	any
case,	whether	it	is	employed	for	ill	health	or	good	health	is	beside	the	point.	The	use	of	occult
toward	any	self-oriented	goal	is	inadvisable.

The	yogic	tradition	is	filled	with	stories	of	the	great	yogi	Gorakhnath.	Some	say	he	lived	in
the	eleventh	century,	but	there	are	many	accounts	that	date	him	much	earlier.	He	was	a	disciple
of	Matsyendranath,	an	illustrious	yogi	in	his	own	right.	Such	was	his	level	of	attainment	that
Matsyendranath	was	often	venerated	as	a	reincarnation	of	Shiva	or	Adiyogi.	The	lore	tells	us
that	Matsyendranath	lived	for	about	six	hundred	years.	This	need	not	be	accepted	literally	or
discarded	as	hagiography	either.	It	essentially	indicates	an	exceptionally	long	life	span	and	the
tremendous	awe	with	which	this	iconic	figure	was	regarded.

Gorakhnath	became	his	disciple,	and	he	adored	and	worshipped	his	master.	Gorakhnath	was
all	fire	and	intensity.	Matsyendranath	saw	too	much	fire	in	him,	and	not	enough	restraint.	Fire
burns	through	many	things,	so	Gorakhnath	started	burning	through	the	walls	of	ignorance,
and	suddenly	he	had	enormous	power.	Matsyendranath	saw	that	he	was	running	a	little	ahead
of	 himself,	 so	 he	 told	 him,	 “Go	 away	 for	 fourteen	 years.	 Don’t	 stay	 near	 me.	 You	 are
imbibing	too	much	from	me.”

This	was	the	hardest	thing	for	Gorakhnath	to	do.	If	Matsyendranath	had	said,	“Give	up	your
life,”	he	would	have	done	it	at	once.	“Go	away”	was	something	he	could	not	bear.	But	since
that	was	what	his	beloved	master	demanded	of	him,	he	went	away.

For	fourteen	years,	he	counted	the	days	and	hours,	waiting	for	the	moment	when	he	could
return.	The	moment	the	period	was	over,	he	came	rushing	back.	When	he	came,	he	found	a
disciple	guarding	the	cave	where	Matsyendranath	lived.	Gorakhnath	said,	“I	want	to	see	my
master!”

```
The	yogi	who	was	guarding	the	cave	said,	“I	have	no	such	instructions,	so	you	had	better
```

wait.”

Gorakhnath	flared	up.	He	said,	“I’ve	waited	for	fourteen	years,	you	fool!	I	don’t	know
when	 _you_ 	came	here.	Maybe	you	came	here	the	day	before	yesterday.	How	dare	you	stop	me!”

He	pushed	him	aside	and	went	into	the	cave.	Matsyendranath	was	not	there.	Gorakhnath
came	back	and	shook	the	disciple	and	said,	“Where	is	he?	I	want	to	see	my	master	now!”

The	disciple	said,	“I	have	no	instructions	to	tell	you	where	he	is.”
Gorakhnath	could	not	contain	himself.	He	used	his	occult	powers,	looked	into	the	disciple’s
mind,	and	identified	where	Matsyendranath	was.	He	then	started	heading	in	that	direction.	His
guru	was	waiting	for	him	halfway.

Matsyendranath	said,	“I	sent	you	away	for	fourteen	years,	because	you	were	beginning	to
become	occult-oriented.	You	were	losing	sight	of	the	spiritual	process	and	beginning	to	enjoy
the	power	that	it	gave	you.	When	you	come	back,	the	first	thing	that	you	do	is	use	occult	to
open	up	your	brother	disciple’s	mind.	Another	fourteen	years	for	you.”

And	so	he	sent	him	away	again.
There	are	many	stories	about	Gorakhnath	making	forays	into	this	forbidden	realm,	and
Matsyendranath	punishing	him	again	and	again.	At	the	same	time,	Gorakhnath	evolved	finally
into	the	greatest	disciple	that	Matsyendranath	ever	produced.

This	is	how	the	practice	of	occult	in	has	always	been	treated	in	the	yogic	culture.	It	was
never	treated	with	respect.	It	was	seen	as	a	way	of	misusing	life,	of	encroaching	into	areas
where	you	should	not.	It	was	practiced	only	by	certain	types	of	people	obsessed	with	power	or
money.

At	the	same	time,	occult	is	not	always	a	negative	thing.	It	has	earned	this	reputation	through
misuse.	Occult	is	essentially	a	technology.	No	science	or	technology	is	intrinsically	negative.
If	we	start	using	technology	to	kill	or	torture	people,	then	after	some	time	we	think,	“Enough
of	this	damn	technology!”	That	is	what	has	happened	to	occult.	Too	many	people	misused	it
for	personal	benefit.	So,	generally	on	the	spiritual	path,	occult	is	shunned.

What	 is	 often	 referred	 to	 as	 occult	 is	 broadly	 what	 we	 know	 as	 _tantra_ .	 In	 the	 current
understanding	 in	 society,	 tantra	 is	 about	 using	 very	 unorthodox	 or	 socially	 unacceptable
methods.	But	in	its	classical	sense,	tantra	simply	means	“technology.”	It	has	nothing	to	do	with
unbridled	sexuality.	It	is	important	to	make	a	clear	distinction	between	the	occult	kind	of	tantra
and	spiritual	tantra.	These	two	were	divided	as	“left-hand	tantra”	and	“right-hand	tantra,”	and
are	completely	different	in	nature.

Left-hand	tantra	involves	various	rituals	which	may	seem	weirder	than	weird	to	many.	The
left	hand	is	very	external;	you	need	materials	and	elaborate	arrangements	to	make	it	happen.
Occult	 practices,	 generally	 referred	 to	 as	 left-hand	 tantra,	 gave	 people	 powers	 to
communicate	across	distances,	to	appear	in	two	different	places	at	the	same	time,	and	use
energies	 to	 their	 own	 benefit	 and	 to	 the	 detriment	 of	 others.	 Right-hand	 tantra	 is	 more
internal;	it	is	about	enabling	you	to	use	your	energies	to	make	things	happen.	You	use	all	the
simple	aspects	of	life	as	a	subjective	science	to	turn	inward	and	do	something	with	yourself.
The	left-hand	tantra	is	a	rudimentary	technology	and	more	available	to	the	uninitiated,	while


the	right-hand	tantra	is	highly	refined	and	only	available	through	powerful	initiations.

Tantra	is	a	certain	capability;	without	it	there	is	no	spiritual	process.	If	you	have	no	tantra	in
you,	you	have	no	technology	to	transform	people;	all	you	have	are	words.	Words	can	be
inspirational	 and	 directional,	 but	 not	 transformative.	 A	 scholar	 cannot	 be	 labeled	 a	 guru.
Without	a	technology	for	transformation	there	is	no	master.	So	there	is	no	guru	without	tantra.
Today	there	are	too	many	people	claiming	to	be	gurus,	but	all	they	are	doing	is	rehashing	the
scriptures.	 A	 true	 guru’s	 work	 is	 to	 overhaul	 the	 entire	 human	 mechanism	 from	 acquired
cyclical	patterns	of	karma	toward	its	ultimate	possibility.	It	is	like	a	mechanic’s	job,	removing
karmic	warts!	If	there	is	no	tantra	or	technology	in	him,	you	cannot	call	that	person	a	guru.


```
SERPENT	POWER
```
The	 word	 _kundalini_ literally	 means	 “energy.”	 It	 refers	 to	 a	 certain	 type	 of
energy	within	every	human	being	which	is	largely	latent	and	unmanifest.	The
kundalini	has	always	been	symbolized	in	the	yogic	tradition	as	a	coiled	cobra.

A	coiled	cobra	knows	stillness	of	a	very	high	quality.	When	the	snake	is
motionless,	it	is	so	absolutely	still	that	even	if	it	is	lying	in	your	way,	you	will
miss	 it.	 Only	 when	 it	 moves	 do	 you	 see	 it.	 But	 these	 coils	 hold	 a	 hidden
volatile	dynamism	within	themselves.	So	kundalini	is	referred	to	as	a	coiled
cobra	 because	 this	 tremendous	 energy	 exists	 within	 each	 and	 every	 human
being,	but	until	it	moves,	you	never	realize	it	is	there.

To	 live	 a	 full-fledged	 physical	 life,	 a	 minuscule	 amount	 of	 this	 physical
energy	is	adequate.	Only	when	the	need	to	transcend	physicality	happens	do
you	need	a	burst	of	energy	which	will	launch	you	beyond	this	reality.	It	is	like
the	difference	in	the	quantum	of	energy	required	in	air	travel	and	in	a	rocket
launch.	 Flying	 within	 the	 atmosphere	 is	 one	 thing	 and	 breaking	 the
atmospheric	barrier	for	space	travel	is	quite	another.	Similarly,	transcending
physicality	requires	another	dimension	of	energy	altogether.

There	is	not	a	single	Indian	temple	where	there	is	no	image	of	a	snake.	This
is	not	because	this	is	a	culture	of	serpent	worshippers.	It	signifies	that	a	sacred
space	holds	the	possibility	of	arousing	the	unmanifest	energies	in	you.

Snakes	are	known	to	be	highly	perceptive	creatures.	(Part	of	the	reason	for
this	of	course	is	that	they	are	stone	deaf	and	perceive	only	reverberation.)	The
snake	is	particularly	drawn	to	a	person	who	is	meditative.	In	the	tradition,	it	is
always	 said	 that	 if	 a	 yogi	 is	 meditating	 in	 a	 place,	 there	 will	 be	 a	 snake
somewhere	nearby.	If	your	energies	become	still,	the	snake	is	naturally	drawn
to	you.

Though	physically	there	is	a	world	of	a	difference	between	a	snake	and	a
human	being,	it	is	very	close	in	terms	of	its	energy	system.	If	you	encounter	a
cobra	 in	 the	 wild,	 you	 might	 find	 it	 coming	 into	 your	 hands	 without	 any
resistance	 because	 its	 energies	 and	 yours	 are	 so	 akin	 to	 each	 other.	 Unless
your	chemistry	shows	alarm	which	it	interprets	as	danger,	the	snake	has	no
intention	of	giving	up	its	venom,	which	is	its	wealth,	the	medicinal	properties
of	which	are	being	increasingly	acknowledged	in	the	world	today.

Historically,	of	course,	the	snake	has	received	much	bad	press	because	of
the	biblical	story	of	Adam	and	Eve.	But	if	you	examine	the	tale	closely,	you’ll


see	it	is	the	snake	that	initiated	life	on	this	planet.	Otherwise	there	was	just	a
dumb	couple	who	didn’t	know	what	to	do	with	themselves.	You	and	I	wouldn’t
have	been	here	without	that	wonderful	serpent!

Ultimately,	 the	 rising	 of	 the	 kundalini	 energy	 sets	 the	 basis	 for	 a	 much
larger	perception	of	life.	Traditional	images	of	Adiyogi,	or	Shiva,	depict	a
snake	with	him	to	indicate	that	his	perception	is	at	its	peak.	Only	if	energy
rises	to	a	certain	level	of	intensity	and	volume	can	reality	be	perceived	in	its
utmost	purity.	Otherwise	every	other	karmic	imprint	that	we	have	(which	goes
right	back	to	the	single-celled	creature	that	we	once	were	millennia	ago)	will
interfere	with	the	way	we	perceive	reality.


Joy	is	a	rare	visitor	in	most	people’s	lives.	The	intention	of	this	book	has	been	to	make	it	your
lifelong	companion.

Joy	is	not	some	elusive	spiritual	goal.	It	is	simply	the	background	milieu	that	is	needed	for
any	aspect	of	your	life	to	unfold	magically	and	wonderfully.	If	joy	is	not	the	ambience	of
your	 life,	 even	 life’s	 most	 pleasurable	 activities	 become	 burdensome.	 The	 issues	 of	 life
around	you	can	be	addressed	to	the	best	of	your	capabilities.	But	once	joy	is	your	constant
companion,	 _you_ 	are	no	more	an	issue	in	your	life.	After	that,	life	is	a	journey	of	endlessly
unfolding	celebration	and	discovery.

For	the	first	time	in	the	history	of	humanity,	we	have	the	necessary	resources,	capability,
and	technology	to	address	every	issue	on	the	planet—of	nourishment,	health,	education,	you
name	 it.	 We	 have	 tremendous	 tools	 of	 science	 and	 technology	 at	 our	 disposal—powerful
enough	to	make	or	break	the	world	several	times	over.	However,	if	the	ability	to	wield	such
powerful	 instruments	 is	 not	 accompanied	 by	 a	 deep	 sense	 of	 compassion,	 inclusiveness,
balance,	and	maturity,	we	could	be	on	the	brink	of	a	global	disaster.	Our	relentless	pursuit	of
external	well-being	is	already	on	the	verge	of	annihilating	the	planet.

Never	before	has	a	generation	of	people	known	the	comforts	and	conveniences	we	have
today.	And	yet,	we	cannot	claim	to	be	the	most	joyful	or	loving	generation	in	history.	A	vast
number	of	people	live	in	states	of	constant	anxiety	and	depression.	Some	are	suffering	their
failure,	 but	 ironically,	 many	 are	 suffering	 the	 consequences	 of	 their	 success.	 Some	 are
suffering	their	limitations,	but	many	are	suffering	their	freedom.

What	is	missing	is	human	consciousness.	Everything	else	is	in	place,	but	the	human	being	is
not	in	place.	If	human	beings	stopped	obstructing	the	path	to	their	own	happiness,	every	other
solution	is	at	hand.	You	cannot	transform	the	world	without	transforming	the	individual.

My	life’s	work	has	been	dedicated	to	empowering	human	beings	to	take	charge	of	their
own	destinies	and	bringing	them	to	a	state	of	joyful	inclusiveness	so	that	the	possibility	that
we	are	does	not	pass	us	by	as	a	generation.	Your	joy,	your	misery,	your	love,	your	agony,
your	bliss,	lie	in	 _your_ 	hands.

```
There	is	a	way	out.	And	the	way	out	is	 in .	It	is	only	by	turning	inward	that	we	can	truly
```

create	a	world	of	love,	light,	and	laughter.	This	book	could	be	a	doorway	to	that	world

```
Let	us	make	it	happen.
```
