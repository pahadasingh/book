If a 1-minute question is taking you 24 hours to complete or feel satisfied with, it suggests you're either overanalyzing or getting stuck in perfectionism. Here are some practical strategies to help you move on to the next question more efficiently:

### 1. **Set Time Limits**  
Allocate a strict time limit (e.g., 2-3 minutes) for each question. Use a timer to remind yourself to move on. This trains your brain to focus and avoid overthinking.

### 2. **Focus on Key Points**  
Concentrate on grasping the key idea of the question rather than understanding every little detail perfectly. It’s important to prioritize the essential parts that contribute to overall understanding.

### 3. **Stop Perfectionism**  
Understand that not every answer has to be perfect on the first read. You can always revisit it later, but moving forward helps build momentum. Accept "good enough" over "perfect" to keep progress going.

### 4. **Practice Speed-Reading**  
Speed-reading techniques can help you skim through content while still capturing important information. Focus on reading the first and last sentences of answers to get the gist quickly.

### 5. **Take Breaks to Recharge**  
Mental fatigue can slow down your pace. Use short, scheduled breaks to refresh your mind and return to the task with more energy.

### 6. **Use Checkpoints**  
Set checkpoints for every few questions (e.g., after 5 or 10 questions), where you pause, review your progress, and see if you're meeting your time targets. This helps keep you on track.

### 7. **Dealing with Complex Questions**
If a question is truly complex, don’t hesitate to mark it for later. Move on and return to it with a fresh perspective.

Breaking the cycle of over-analysis requires consistent practice. Can you identify what's causing the extended time (e.g., self-doubt, fear of forgetting)? That might offer clues on how to adjust further.
