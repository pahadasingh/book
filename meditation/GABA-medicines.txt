#### **a. GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) Supplements**
- **What it is**: Direct GABA supplements provide GABA in pill or powder form.

#### **b. L-Theanine**
- **What it is**: An amino acid found in tea leaves, particularly green and black tea.
- **How it works**: L-Theanine can cross the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to increase GABA, dopamine, and serotonin levels, promoting relaxation without drowsiness.
- **Benefits**: Reduces stress and anxiety, enhances focus, and improves sleep quality.
- **Potential Side Effects**: L-Theanine is considered safe with few known side effects, but in high doses, it may cause mild drowsiness.
- **Dosage**: Typical doses range from 100 mg to 400 mg per day.

#### **c. Magnesium Supplements**
- **What it is**: Magnesium is a mineral that plays a role in activating GABA receptors.

- **Potential Side Effects**: May cause drowsiness, gastrointestinal upset, or allergic reactions in some people.
- **Dosage**: Common doses are 300-600 mg of an extract standardized to contain withanolides.

#### **f. Lemon Balm**

### **2. Prescription Medications that Affect GABA**
There are several medications prescribed for anxiety, sleep disorders, and epilepsy that directly impact GABA levels or GABA receptors in the brain. These should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider.

#### **a. Benzodiazepines (e.g., Xanax, Valium, Ativan)**
- **What it is**: A class of drugs commonly prescribed for anxiety, panic disorders, and sleep disorders.
- **How it works**: Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of GABA in the brain by binding to GABA receptors, which helps calm nervous system activity.
- **Benefits**: Provides quick relief for anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia.
- **Potential Side Effects**: Sedation, drowsiness, memory impairment, dependency, and withdrawal symptoms. Long-term use is not recommended due to the risk of addiction.
- **Common Brands**: Xanax (alprazolam), Valium (diazepam), Ativan (lorazepam).
- **Dosage**: Depends on the specific drug and condition, typically prescribed by a healthcare provider.

#### **b. Gabapentin (Neurontin)**
- **What it is**: An anticonvulsant medication also used for anxiety and nerve pain.
- **How it works**: Gabapentin is thought to increase GABA activity in the brain, helping to reduce anxiety and nervous system hyperactivity.
- **Benefits**: Reduces anxiety, neuropathic pain, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome.
- **Potential Side Effects**: Drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, and coordination issues.
- **Dosage**: Varies based on the condition being treated, but typically 300 mg to 900 mg per day.

#### **c. Pregabalin (Lyrica)**
- **What it is**: Similar to gabapentin, pregabalin is used for nerve pain, anxiety, and seizures.
- **How it works**: Pregabalin binds to certain subunits of calcium channels in the brain, which increases GABA levels and reduces excitatory nerve signals.
- **Benefits**: Treats generalized anxiety disorder, nerve pain, and epilepsy.
- **Potential Side Effects**: Dizziness, sleepiness, weight gain, and blurry vision.
- **Dosage**: Usually ranges from 150 mg to 600 mg per day, depending on the condition.
