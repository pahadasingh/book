1    do you like 
2    traveling yes I do traveling can help me 
3    learn local cultures and 
4    Customs I can also taste a variety of 
5    local food I think it's great to travel 
6    with friends and 
7    families it might be even better if I 
8    could travel 
9    overseas where do you like to go when 
10   you go 
11   traveling I don't like very crowded 
12   places I don't like to visit the tourist 
13   attractions but I would like to visit 
14   some people's home and some unique 
15   restaurants I can learn a lot from just 
16   walking in the city have you ever 
17   traveled for a long time yes I went to 
18   yunan Province last summer and stayed 
19   there for almost 2 weeks it's really my 
20   longest trip so far I like like the 
21   stone forests in coming and biging 
22   ancient town the culture and 
23   construction styles are very different 
24   from cities in my hometown do you like 
25   long trips if I have enough time I think 
26   long trips are nice because I can always 
27   learn new things by staying there for a 
28   longer time also if I have plenty of 
29   time to explore a place I I won't feel 
30   too tired how do you feel when you 
31   travel I can always feel relaxed and 
32   excited because I can see different 
33   things and learn the local cultures and 
34   Customs do you prefer to travel alone or 
35   with other people I prefer to travel 
36   with other people because I can talk 
37   with them and share our 
38   experiences also I'm not good at 
39   directions if I travel with others I 
40   don't need to worry about getting lost 
41   which country would you like to travel 
42   to in the future if I have enough money 
43   I'd like to travel to Egypt it's a 
44   mysterious country to me and I always 
45   want to walk in the 
46   pyramids I think I might even find the 
47   berry treasure if I'm lucky enough 
48   housework do people do a lot of 
49   housework in your country yes many 
50   people like to do the housework 
51   themselves because they believe it is 
52   their own private matters but it seems 
53   more people like to pay for somebody 
54   else to do the hous workk for them 
55   because in their mind their time is more 
56   valuable than doing housework did you do 
57   a lot of housework when you were a child 
58   well I have to say sorry to my parents 
59   cuz you know when I was a child my 
60   parents wanted me to spend all my time 
61   in studying or playing and so they did 
62   not ask me to do any housework is it 
63   important for a child to do housework 
64   maybe I am not so sure it is possible 
65   for them to do housework to understand 
66   the value of life or to know more about 
67   life cuz I didn't do a lot of housework 
68   when I was a child I couldn't really 
69   tell whether it is important or not what 
70   kind of housework do you have to do in 
71   China usually some cleaning jobs such as 
72   mopping the floor cleaning the table or 
73   the dishes and making the beds what 
74   different kinds of housework do men and 
75   women do well many a Time men will do 
76   some housework like changing the bulbs 
77   fixing the locks or Plumbing but now 
78   more men are sharing other housework 
79   with women should children help their 
80   parents to do some housework yes I think 
81   it is a good idea to ask children to 
82   help their parents to do some housework 
83   in this way the children can not only 
84   learn some practical skills but also 
85   have a sense of their parents hard work 
86   home and family do you live in a house 
87   or a flat I live in a flat it's a 15 
88   story building and my home is on the 
89   fifth floor we have three bedrooms and a 
90   big living room I like my home because 
91   it's spacious do you like to live in a 
92   big city or a small town it's a dilemma 
93   I think it would be nice to live in the 
94   countryside but work and enjoy the 
95   modern facilities in the city right now 
96   I live in big cities I have access to 
97   all kinds of modern facilities and it's 
98   also easier for me to find a suitable 
99   job however the air pollution and 
100  traffic problems sometimes drive me 
101  crazy I think I'll move to the 
102  countryside after I get retired which 
103  room is your favorite in your home I 
104  love our living room because it's 
105  spacious I could watch TV and play 
106  computer games there I also like the 
107  view from the big window was from there 
108  I could see the river in my city and the 
109  beautiful trees along the river I think 
110  I spend most of the time at home in the 
111  living room beside sleeping time do you 
112  like changing your flat if I have the 
113  option if it'll be nice to move to a 
114  beggar flat I will never complain about 
115  having a big flat if I do I want be able 
116  to hold parties with my friends and even 
117  play badminton in our living room now we 
118  would usually feel crowded if we have a 
119  guest with a big flat this won't be a 
120  problem anymore is it good for family 
121  members to eat together absolutely for 
122  for a lot of Chinese families dinner 
123  time is a quality time that the family 
124  can spend together because during that 
125  time we'll concentrate on our meal and 
126  set our tasks or homework aside if 
127  family members do not eat together I 
128  think it'll be hard for the people who 
129  live under the same roof to know each 
130  other well do you know your neighbors 
131  yes I recently moved to the this new 
132  home so I don't know most of my 
133  neighbors but one day when I was walking 
134  down the stairs I saw one of my 
135  neighbors a young girl and then I 
136  started saying hello and made new GRS 
137  with her from then on I would always 
138  talk to her when I see her in the 
139  stairway I feel it's good to know my 
140  neighbors because when I have some 
141  problems or troubles I could ask them 
142  them for help do you prefer young or old 
143  neighbors I prefer young neighbors 
144  especially people of my age because we 
145  went more likely to have things in 
146  common it's easier for us to communicate 
147  and we could even do some outdoor 
148  activities together however if have old 
149  neighbors I will be able to learn life 
150  experience from them what do you think 
151  can be added to your flat 
152  I it's possible I love to have a guest 
153  room added sometimes my friends visit 
154  but my home is too tiny so they have to 
155  sleep in the living room I always feel 
156  embarrassed for that with an extra guest 
157  room everything will be solved besides 
158  if we don't have guests I can use it as 
159  my private study room which will help me 
160  study more effective acely handcraft 
161  when do you need to make something 
162  yourself I usually don't need to make 
163  things myself because we can always find 
164  everything at 
165  supermarkets but occasionally I make 
166  scarves or sweaters by myself it's like 
167  my pastime hobby I would always feel a 
168  sense of success when I complete a 
169  project is it good for children to do 
170  more Hands-On activities I think so when 
171  children make things themselves they're 
172  more likely to remember things and their 
173  interest will be aroused during the 
174  process it's also a good way to teach 
175  them to be independent when children use 
176  their hands they'll need to think and 
177  their brains will also be developed 
178  better should children learn a certain 
179  skill in their early age it depends is 
180  they're interested in something such as 
181  drawing and playing instruments it's 
182  helpful for them to start early they'll 
183  have more career choices when they grow 
184  older if they have some special 
185  skills however if the children don't 
186  want to learn a skill that the parents 
187  think is important it'll be wise for 
188  parents to respect the Children's Choice 
189  did you ever learn to make something by 
190  hand yes when I was a child even in the 
191  kindergarten my teachers had taught me 
192  how to make a paper plane and paper bird 
193  it was quite encouraging to see things 
194  made by my own hands do you think it is 
195  popular in China these days handmade 
196  things are becoming popular cuz you know 
197  some handmade things are so unique and 
198  exquisite that no such machines can 
199  produce on some other occasions when 
200  people are bored with those things 
201  massive produced by machines they may 
202  choose to make one with their own hands 
203  if you have a chance what do you want to 
204  learn if I have the chance I would like 
205  to learn to make a kite with my own 
206  hands you know when I was a child I like 
207  to fly kites very much and my father had 
208  bought me a lot of kites but I dreamed 
209  of having one kite made all by myself 
210  that that could fly higher than any of 
211  my classmates and friends but I never 
212  had a chance to do so because my father 
213  was too busy with his business and could 
214  not provide me with the necessary 
215  material and skills did you do 
216  handcrafts at school I actually had a 
217  handcraft class when I was in elementary 
218  school and the teacher would teach us to 
219  do all kinds of hand crafts I would 
220  always feel proud of myself when I 
221  brought my own artworks home do you 
222  think chines people like making 
223  handcrafts I think so in the past a lot 
224  of people would make their own sweaters 
225  and now crossstitch is getting popular 
226  among young ladies happiness what can 
227  make you feel happy a lot of things for 
228  example if I hear some good news about 
229  myself or people around me I will feel 
230  happy last month one of my cousins gave 
231  birth to a baby girl I felt happy for 
232  her and for the newborn baby the other 
233  day I bought a nice bag on sale which 
234  also made me feel happy I guess life is 
235  full of happiness and we just need to 
236  have the eyes to discover it how to 
237  improve your happiness level we need to 
238  treat ourselves well when it's time to 
239  rest we should make excuses to work or 
240  study too much we should exercise more 
241  and eat healthily in order to keep our 
242  body fit if we're healthy physically 
243  we'll also feel happy mentally in 
244  addition having good social connections 
245  can also make us feel happier so we 
246  should treat the people around us nicely 
247  will unhappy things influence your mood 
248  definitely sometimes just a tiny unhappy 
249  thing can ruin a whole day for example 
250  if I have some conflicts with another 
251  driver while I'm driving or riding a 
252  bike this incident will haunt me the 
253  whole time on my way to work or school 
254  if I learn that I didn't do well on an 
255  exam which I have studied for a whole 
256  month I'll will probably be upset for a 
257  few days is happiness important of 
258  course that's why we use the words 
259  related to happiness to show our good 
260  wishes such as happy New Year have a 
261  good time and enjoy your meal if we're 
262  happy we are more likely to enjoy a 
263  longer life also happy students can 
264  study well and happy workers can work 
265  more productively 
266  so we have to remind ourselves and 
267  people around us to be happy all the 
268  time what do we do with happy things and 
269  sad things if we have happy things we 
270  should definitely share them with the 
271  people we know happiness can be 
272  multiplied in this way if we have 
273  something sad or unpleasant it's better 
274  to share our feelings with our friends 
275  or families as well also when we feel 
276  down we have to think positively and 
277  shouldn't let depression overcome us can 
278  money make people 
279  happier sometimes it does but money 
280  doesn't work when it comes to long-term 
281  happiness money can buy us material 
282  satisfaction but spiritually it is pale 
283  and weak although we need money to buy 
284  us daily 
285  Necessities but we should wouldn't be 
286  obsessed with making more and more money 
287  especially when we have to sacrifice our 
288  family or house a lot of rich people 
289  will eventually regret it when they get 
290  money and lose everything else in the 
291  end are all kinds of unhappiness bad not 
292  necessarily on some occasions when we 
293  are stuck in 
294  unhappiness we may learn something that 
295  is helpful to us so that we will not 
296  suffer from the unhappiness in this 
297  aspect again in this sense the 
298  unhappiness is just a kind of beneficial 
299  experience leisure time do you watch TV 
300  often I used to but not anymore after I 
301  found that the internet can give me a 
302  lot more choices for 
303  entertainment I just don't have much 
304  time for TV anymore but I still watch TV 
305  occasionally with my family after dinner 
306  or at weekends I sometimes wish there 
307  were fewer advertisements to stop me in 
308  the middle of a TV drama or entertaining 
309  program what programs do you like when I 
310  watch TV I like dramas and entertaining 
311  programs once you watch a TV series 
312  you'll find very difficult to Let It Go 
313  you just have to finish it and find the 
314  ending of the story I also like 
315  entertaining 
316  programs especially the ones which 
317  involve famous movie stars or singers I 
318  don't know why but I'm interested in 
319  their lives and always want to find out 
320  more about them do you like watching TV 
321  with your family or friends or by 
322  yourself I don't like watching TV alone 
323  I prefer to do it with my friends or 
324  family members when I watch TV I also 
325  like talking and sharing my feelings 
326  with others it's like an important part 
327  of TV watching when I watch TV alone I 
328  will feel bored and hard to 
329  concentrate do you think you watch too 
330  much TV when you were a child I don't 
331  think so you know when I was a child my 
332  parents were very strict with me and 
333  they even forced me to learn many other 
334  skills after I finished my 
335  schoolwork actually I missed a lot of 
336  interesting cartoon programs in my 
337  childhood how much free time do you have 
338  I have a lot of free time about 5 to 6 
339  hours a day I would usually stay at home 
340  to surf the Internet or read books 
341  occasionally I would go shopping or go 
342  on Shore trips in the evenings do you 
343  prefer to relax at home and watch TV or 
344  go out with your friends I think both 
345  are good for me half to half would be a 
346  good 
347  balance I like spending some time with 
348  my friends each week but definitely not 
349  every day because I also need some quiet 
350  time to think and read by myself do you 
351  think it's important to have time to 
352  relax I think so when I'm too busy with 
353  my 
354  schoolwork I usually feel very stressed 
355  I just need some time to do nothing but 
356  relax do men and women relax in the same 
357  way sometimes but men like sports more 
358  than women they would go to play 
359  basketball or 
360  football but women may enjoy sh shopping 
361  more when do you spend time with your 
362  family or your friends these days when 
363  everyone in the family is so busy with 
364  their own personal 
365  matters it seems they are having fewer 
366  chances to spend time together so do I 
367  usually I may stay with my parents on 
368  holidays especially he Spring Festival 
369  on other 
370  occasions I stay with my friends more 
371  mainly because we are doing similar 
372  things together who are more important 
373  to you family or friends in my deepest 
374  heart I think family is more important 
375  to me although sometimes I may spend 
376  more time with my friends you know we 
377  can only be born once by our parents but 
378  we can make new friends all the time 
379  besides in this benefit oriented Society 
380  only parents truly love us therefore 
381  family should be on a more important 
382  position what's the most difficult part 
383  about language learning for beginners 
384  pronunciation might be difficult but as 
385  you learn more you'll realize if you 
386  don't have a big 
387  vocabulary it's hard to get around in 
388  that new 
389  language so at that stage memorizing a 
390  lot of words might be very challenging 
391  for learning a new 
392  language are there a lot of people 
393  choosing English as their 
394  major yes English is becoming the 
395  international language and it's a very 
396  useful tool for us because of the 
397  globalization many companies need to do 
398  business with foreign countries so 
399  people who are good at English are in 
400  high 
401  demand actually nowadays non-english 
402  major students also put a lot effort 
403  into learning 
404  English how many foreign languages do 
405  you know I only speak English and I know 
406  a little Japanese and Korean mostly from 
407  the TV dramas I've 
408  watched I always admire people who can 
409  speak many foreign 
410  languages because language doesn't only 
411  convey meanings but also can convey 
412  cultures what other foreign languages do 
413  you want to learn if I have enough time 
414  i' like to learn Korean and 
415  Spanish because I always watch Korean 
416  dramas and I think it'll be 
417  cool if I could understand what they are 
418  saying without looking at the subtitles 
419  if I know Spanish I'll be able to use it 
420  in many countries such as Spain and 
421  Mexico what are advantages of being able 
422  to speak other languages other than the 
423  native one I think there are a few 
424  advantages you can communicate with 
425  people more 
426  fluently you can exchange you ideas and 
427  understand their culture 
428  better also 
429  it's one way to improve your language 
430  skills mobile phones do you have a 
431  mobile phone what do you use it for is 
432  your cell phone important for you in 
433  your daily 
434  life yes I have a mobile phone and I 
435  cannot imagine a life without my mobile 
436  phone I use it to send messages or call 
437  my family and my 
438  friends sometimes I also use a mobile 
439  phone to get on the 
440  internet when do you use it how often do 
441  you use it whenever I have something to 
442  discuss with my family or friends I use 
443  a mobile 
444  phone or when I want to search some 
445  information I get on the internet by 
446  mobile 
447  phone I use it every day and I cannot 
448  imagine a life without a mobile phone I 
449  may not lead a normal life with it when 
450  did you get your first mobile phone in 
451  my middle school I got my first mobile 
452  phone as a birthday 
453  present it's a Nokia so I have developed 
454  great love for the brand Nokia and 
455  that's why I still use Nokia 
456  now I think Nokia can type messages very 
457  fast what feature of your cell phone do 
458  you like the best best what's the 
459  difference between sending a text 
460  message and calling 
461  someone I like the function of messages 
462  very much in fact I prefer sending 
463  messages to making a phone 
464  call because I think you won't bother 
465  others when sending 
466  messages and they will reply you as soon 
467  as they see the 
468  message of course if you have something 
469  urgent to discuss 
470  making a phone call will be 
471  better is there anything you dislike 
472  about using cell phones not really I 
473  think I dislike about using cell phones 
474  only when it occupies a lot of my 
475  time and I don't have enough time to 
476  finish important and urgent 
477  things I don't use it so often 
478  now do you think you will continue using 
479  your mobile phone in the 
480  future of course I will continue using 
481  mobile phones in the 
482  future because I cannot leave a mobile 
483  phone and lead a normal 
484  life but maybe one day I will change my 
485  Nokia for iPhone since it's so popular 
486  nowadays computer do you like using the 
487  computer definitely I think the computer 
488  has become an important part in my 
489  life I use it to do my homework work get 
490  on the internet to do research and get 
491  some entertainment as 
492  well I can't imagine what my life will 
493  be like if I don't have the 
494  computer do you use the computer 
495  often yes I spend almost more than 5 
496  hours a day on my 
497  computer I use a the computer to get 
498  online and do my homework 
499  work of course I also play games in chat 
500  with friends 
501  occasionally however sometimes I tend to 
502  spend too much time on the 
503  computer which is not good for my eyes 
504  and my spine I think I should try not to 
505  use a computer all the four 
506  time introduce 
507  one what is your 
508  name my name is Nero my nickname is June

743  members well I live in a nuclear family 
744  just like many other people of my age my 
745  father is a civil servant in the 
746  government my mother is a doctor in a 
747  hospital we're all busy with our own 
748  business so it is is not easy for us to 
749  get 
750  together should young people live with 
751  the 
752  old just as the saying goes the old are 
753  The Treasure of the family one 
754  definitely think young people should 
755  live with the old if they have the

757  lot of different kinds of advice from 
758  the old and of course the old could get

1101 a 
1102 gift last month my sister bought a very 
1103 beautiful sweater for me it was a good 
1104 gift actually I don't receive gifts 
1105 often but I'm always happy to have 
1106 them do you prefer to receiving a gift

1118 hometown when I saw the happy smile on 
1119 her face I felt delighted
