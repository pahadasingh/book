 358  really 
 359  do you think it's gotten lumpy yeah my 
 360  back has been hurting lately 
 361  hmm mine too should we go to the 
 362  mattress store today 
 363  let's do it i'll get our clothes from 
 364  the closet

 376  bottle thanks 
 377  okay i have to hurry i have to get to 
 378  work me too 
 379  see you tonight hey do you want to watch 
 380  some tv 
 381  yeah but i think we should move the tv 
 382  to that wall over there 
 383  why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 384  i know 
 385  but i just think it would look better 
 386  over there all right but we have to move 
 387  the coffee table too 
 388  okay let's put the couch over on that 
 389  side of the room 
 390  and we can put the coffee table right 
 391  here hmm 
 392  and what about the bookshelf i know we 
 393  can put it on that wall 
 394  okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 395  tv 
 396  after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 397  let's watch one show 
 398  great let's watch friends i think we 
 399  should have a dinner party 
 400  that's a great idea we could have about 
 401  eight people 
 402  yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 403  i think the table fits six 
 404  but we can add an extension to it okay 
 405  and maybe we should change the lighting 
 406  in the dining room yeah maybe we should 
 407  buy some new lamps for the corners of 
 408  the room 
 409  and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 410  looks nice still 
 411  i think so but i could pick up a new one 
 412  tomorrow we should think about the food 
 413  should we hire a catering company that's 
 414  a really good idea 
 415  how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 416  friend anne has a company 
 417  i'll ask her if she's free sounds good 
 418  i think we should redecorate this 
 419  basement really what do you want to use 
 420  it for 
 421  well i was thinking about turning it 
 422  into an artist studio that's a nice idea 
 423  are you thinking of painting again yeah 
 424  and there's all this room down here 
 425  now that we're down here do you think we 
 426  need a new water heater 
 427  yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 428  we've redone it all right 
 429  i'll look into that first great and i'll 
 430  start thinking about the design for the 
 431  studio 
 432  i think i could teach classes down here 
 433  too that's a nice idea 
 434  yeah i was thinking about giving art 
 435  classes to the neighborhood kids 
 436  i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 437  clean out this garage 
 438  i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 439  since when did we get so much stuff 
 440  i don't know like these skis when was 
 441  the last time we used these 
 442  maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 443  i forgot all about that we should have a 
 444  garage sale 
 445  that's such a good idea we can make some 
 446  money and clear this place out 
 447  exactly should we do it on saturday yeah 
 448  i'll go print out some flyers i really 
 449  think we need new desks in here 
 450  yeah we do so much work in here that 
 451  it'd be worth it okay let's go shopping 
 452  later this week 
 453  great okay i really need to get some 
 454  work done now 
 455  all right i'll just sit on the couch 
 456  here okay 
 457  you know now that i look into it the 
 458  study could use a new couch too 
 459  you're right okay i'll let you get to 
 460  work okay thanks 
 461  do you mind plugging my laptop in sure 
 462  thanks 
 463  and have you seen my cell phone yeah 
 464  it's on this shelf here 
 465  i'll get it for you thanks i 
 466  love how much sun we get out here on the 
 467  porch 
 468  oh me too you know what would be nice 
 469  what a porch swing 
 470  yes and i think we could use a few more 
 471  plants out here 
 472  you're right maybe some more flowers 
 473  yeah and i was thinking we could plant 
 474  some tomatoes 
 475  too i love that idea i'll go to the 
 476  hardware store this afternoon 
 477  and see if they have seeds great this 
 478  attic is so 
 479  creepy yeah we haven't been up here in 
 480  forever 
 481  there are so many cobwebs yeah i think 
 482  that might be a squirrel's nest over 
 483  there 
 484  oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 485  well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 486  i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 487  don't you think that could be the 
 488  squirrels 
 489  yeah probably i think we should get this 
 490  place cleaned up so we can use it 
 491  yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 492  hey when was the last time we went on a 
 493  holiday gosh 
 494  i don't remember was it two years ago 
 495  when we went to the beach 
 496  i guess so i didn't realize so much time 
 497  had passed 
 498  i know so do you think it's time for 
 499  another trip 
 500  absolutely i think i can get two weeks 
 501  off work 
 502  same here i think i have some days saved 
 503  up great 
 504  all we have to do is make some plans 
 505  yeah why don't we sit down tonight and 
 506  talk about it 
 507  okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 508  sites today 
 509  so will i okay so i checked out some 
 510  holiday options 
 511  me too i think we should go to the 
 512  mountains i was thinking the same thing 
 513  yes we could do hiking and maybe go 
 514  somewhere with hot springs 
 515  i love that idea great me too so did you 
 516  find any hotels you liked 
 517  i actually did wonderful yeah i found a 
 518  place that has a spa 
 519  and is it really expensive i think we 
 520  can afford it 
 521  i'll call to make reservations tomorrow 
 522  hello 
 523  travel agency how can i help you yes i'm 
 524  looking to book a room for two weeks 
 525  when will you be visiting do you have 
 526  availability next month 
 527  yes we do the last two weeks are open 
 528  great i need one room for two people and 
 529  would you like twin beds or a queen size 
 530  bed 
 531  a queen sized all right and do you have 
 532  any other questions 
 533  yes is the use of the spa included yes 
 534  it is 
 535  that's great we can't wait to go were 
 536  you able to make a hotel reservation 
 537  yes we have a room for two weeks next 
 538  month that's great 
 539  we should book a flight i thought maybe 
 540  we should drive oh 
 541  i guess it's not too far it's about a 
 542  seven hour drive right 
 543  yeah and then we could save on renting a 
 544  car while we're there 
 545  that's very true we should get the car 
 546  tuned up before we go 
 547  that's a really good idea we don't want 
 548  any car trouble on the way 
 549  yeah i can get that done after work 
 550  tomorrow 
 551  thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 552  next week

 951  oh it's a beautiful day 
 952  it really is how did you sleep pretty 
 953  good 
 954  but i think we may need a new mattress 
 955  really 
 956  do you think it's gotten lumpy yeah my 
 957  back has been hurting lately 
 958  hmm mine too should we go to the 
 959  mattress store today 
 960  let's do it i'll get our clothes from 
 961  the closet 
 962  hello are you in there yeah i'll just be 
 963  one more minute 
 964  okay but i really need to take a shower

 970  oh yeah thanks and do you know if we 
 971  have new shampoo 
 972  no but there's a little bit left in the 
 973  bottle thanks okay i have to hurry i 
 974  have to get to work 
 975  me too see you tonight hey do you want 
 976  to watch some tv 
 977  yeah but i think we should move the tv 
 978  to that wall over there 
 979  why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 980  i know 
 981  but i just think it would look better 
 982  over there all right but we have to move 
 983  the coffee table too 
 984  okay let's put the couch over on that 
 985  side of the room 
 986  and we can put the coffee table right 
 987  here hmm 
 988  and what about the bookshelf i know we 
 989  can put it on that wall 
 990  okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 991  tv 
 992  after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 993  let's watch one show 
 994  great let's watch friends i think we 
 995  should have a dinner party 
 996  that's a great idea we could have about 
 997  eight people 
 998  yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 999  i think the table fits six 
 1000 but we can add an extension to it okay 
 1001 and maybe we should change the lighting 
 1002 in the dining room 
 1003 yeah maybe we should buy some new lamps 
 1004 for the corners of the room 
 1005 and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 1006 looks nice still i think so 
 1007 but i could pick up a new one tomorrow 
 1008 we should think about the food 
 1009 should we hire a catering company that's 
 1010 a really good idea 
 1011 how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 1012 friend anne has a company i'll ask her 
 1013 if she's free 
 1014 sounds good i think we should redecorate 
 1015 this basement 
 1016 really what do you want to use it for 
 1017 well i was thinking about turning it 
 1018 into an artist studio that's a nice idea 
 1019 are you thinking of painting again yeah 
 1020 and there's all this room down here 
 1021 now that we're down here do you think we 
 1022 need a new water heater 
 1023 yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 1024 we've redone it all right 
 1025 i'll look into that first great and i'll 
 1026 start thinking about the design for the 
 1027 studio 
 1028 i think i could teach classes down here 
 1029 too that's a nice idea 
 1030 yeah i was thinking about giving art 
 1031 classes to the neighborhood kids 
 1032 i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 1033 clean out this garage 
 1034 i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 1035 since when did we get so much stuff 
 1036 i don't know like these skis when was 
 1037 the last time we used these 
 1038 maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 1039 i forgot all about that we should have a 
 1040 garage sale 
 1041 that's such a good idea we can make some 
 1042 money and clear this place out 
 1043 exactly should we do it on saturday yeah 
 1044 i'll go print out some flyers i really 
 1045 think we need new desks in here 
 1046 yeah we do so much work in here that 
 1047 it'd be worth 
 1048 it okay let's go shopping later this 
 1049 week great 
 1050 okay i really need to get some work done 
 1051 now all right 
 1052 i'll just sit on the couch here okay you 
 1053 know now that i look into it 
 1054 the study could use a new couch too 
 1055 you're right 
 1056 okay i'll let you get to work okay 
 1057 thanks do you mind plugging my laptop in 
 1058 sure thanks and have you seen my cell 
 1059 phone yeah it's on the shelf here 
 1060 i'll get it for you thanks i 
 1061 love how much sun we get out here on the 
 1062 porch 
 1063 oh me too you know what would be nice 
 1064 what a porch swing 
 1065 yes and i think we could use a few more 
 1066 plants out here 
 1067 you're right maybe some more flowers 
 1068 yeah and i was thinking we could plant 
 1069 some tomatoes 
 1070 too i love that idea i'll go to the 
 1071 hardware store this afternoon 
 1072 and see if they have seats great this 
 1073 attic is so creepy 
 1074 yeah we haven't been up here in forever 
 1075 there are so many cobwebs 
 1076 yeah i think that might be a squirrel's 
 1077 nest over there 
 1078 oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 1079 well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 1080 i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 1081 don't you think that could be the 
 1082 squirrels 
 1083 yeah probably i think we should get this 
 1084 place cleaned up so we can use it 
 1085 yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 1086 hey when was the last time we went on a 
 1087 holiday gosh 
 1088 i don't remember was it two years ago 
 1089 when we went to the beach 
 1090 i guess so i didn't realize so much time 
 1091 had passed 
 1092 i know so do you think it's time for 
 1093 another trip 
 1094 absolutely i think i can get two weeks 
 1095 off work 
 1096 same here i think i have some days saved 
 1097 up 
 1098 great all we have to do is make some 
 1099 plans yeah why don't we sit down tonight 
 1100 and talk about it 
 1101 okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 1102 sites today 
 1103 so will i okay so i checked out some 
 1104 holiday options 
 1105 me too i think we should go to the 
 1106 mountains i was thinking the same thing 
 1107 yes we could do hiking and maybe go 
 1108 somewhere with hot springs 
 1109 i love that idea great me too so did you 
 1110 find any hotels you liked 
 1111 i actually did wonderful yeah i found a 
 1112 place that has a spa 
 1113 and is it really expensive i think we 
 1114 can afford it 
 1115 i'll call to make reservations tomorrow 
 1116 hello 
 1117 travel agency how can i help you yes i'm 
 1118 looking to book a room for two weeks 
 1119 when will you be visiting do you have 
 1120 availability next month 
 1121 yes we do the last two weeks are open 
 1122 great 
 1123 i need one room for two people and would 
 1124 you like twin beds or a queen size bed a 
 1125 queen sized 
 1126 all right and do you have any other 
 1127 questions yes 
 1128 is the use of the spa included yes it is 
 1129 that's great we can't wait to go were 
 1130 you able to make a hotel reservation 
 1131 yes we have a room for two weeks next 
 1132 month that's great 
 1133 we should book a flight i thought maybe 
 1134 we should drive oh 
 1135 i guess it's not too far it's about a 
 1136 seven hour drive right 
 1137 yeah and then we could save on renting a 
 1138 car while we're there 
 1139 that's very true we should get the car 
 1140 tuned up before we go 
 1141 that's a really good idea we don't want 
 1142 any car trouble on the way 
 1143 yeah i can get that done after work 
 1144 tomorrow 
 1145 thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 1146 next week

 1148 know i'm so excited 
 1149 me too have you thought about what 
 1150 you're going to bring not at all 
 1151 me neither okay let's think we'll need 
 1152 hiking boots 
 1153 and swimsuits for the pool and we should 
 1154 bring bug spray

 1156 our water bottles 
 1157 yeah and clothes for cool weather right

 1162 car great because we'll need the gps to 
 1163 get there

 1169 on the way out of town yeah and we can 
 1170 pick up some snacks and coffee there

 1174 beautiful waterfall nearby

 1547 think we may need a new mattress 
 1548 really do you think it's gotten lumpy 
 1549 yeah my back has been hurting lately 
 1550 hmm mine too should we go to the 
 1551 mattress store today 
 1552 let's do it i'll get our clothes from 
 1553 the closet 
 1554 hello are you in there yeah i'll just be 
 1555 one more minute 
 1556 okay but i really need to take a shower

 1562 they're in the closet oh yeah thanks and 
 1563 do you know if we have new shampoo

 1565 bottle thanks 
 1566 okay i have to hurry i have to get to 
 1567 work me too 
 1568 see you tonight hey do you want to watch 
 1569 some tv 
 1570 yeah but i think we should move the tv 
 1571 to that wall over there 
 1572 why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 1573 i know 
 1574 but i just think it would look better 
 1575 over there all right but we have to move 
 1576 the coffee table too 
 1577 okay let's put the couch over on that 
 1578 side of the room 
 1579 and we can put the coffee table right 
 1580 here hmm 
 1581 and what about the bookshelf i know we 
 1582 can put it on that wall 
 1583 okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 1584 tv 
 1585 after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 1586 let's watch one show 
 1587 great let's watch friends i think we 
 1588 should have a dinner party 
 1589 that's a great idea we could have about 
 1590 eight people 
 1591 yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 1592 i think the table fits six 
 1593 but we can add an extension to it okay 
 1594 and maybe we should change the lighting 
 1595 in the dining room 
 1596 yeah maybe we should buy some new lamps 
 1597 for the corners of the room 
 1598 and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 1599 looks nice still 
 1600 i think so but i could pick up a new one 
 1601 tomorrow we should think about the food 
 1602 should we hire a catering company that's 
 1603 a really good idea 
 1604 how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 1605 friend anne has a company 
 1606 i'll ask her if she's free sounds good 
 1607 i think we should redecorate this 
 1608 basement really 
 1609 what do you want to use it for well i 
 1610 was thinking about turning it 
 1611 into an artist studio that's a nice idea 
 1612 are you thinking of painting again 
 1613 yeah and there's all this room down here 
 1614 now that we're down here 
 1615 do you think we need a new water heater 
 1616 yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 1617 we've redone it 
 1618 all right i'll look into that first 
 1619 great and i'll start thinking about the 
 1620 design for the studio 
 1621 i think i could teach classes down here 
 1622 too that's a nice idea 
 1623 yeah i was thinking about giving art 
 1624 classes to the neighborhood kids 
 1625 i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 1626 clean out this garage 
 1627 i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 1628 since when did we get so much stuff 
 1629 i don't know like these skis when was 
 1630 the last time we used these 
 1631 maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 1632 i forgot all about that we should have a 
 1633 garage sale 
 1634 that's such a good idea we can make some 
 1635 money and clear this place out 
 1636 exactly should we do it on saturday yeah 
 1637 i'll go print 
 1638 out some flyers i really think we need 
 1639 new desks in here 
 1640 yeah we do so much work in here that 
 1641 it'd be worth it 
 1642 okay let's go shopping later this week 
 1643 great okay 
 1644 i really need to get some work done now 
 1645 all right i'll just sit on the couch 
 1646 here 
 1647 okay you know now that i look into it 
 1648 the study could use a new couch too 
 1649 you're right okay i'll let you get to 
 1650 work okay thanks 
 1651 do you mind plugging my laptop in sure 
 1652 thanks 
 1653 and have you seen my cell phone yeah 
 1654 it's on the shelf here i'll get it for 
 1655 you 
 1656 thanks i love how much sun we get out 
 1657 here on the porch 
 1658 oh me too you know what would be nice 
 1659 what a porch swing 
 1660 yes and i think we could use a few more 
 1661 plants out here 
 1662 you're right maybe some more flowers 
 1663 yeah and i was thinking we could plant 
 1664 some tomatoes too i love that idea i'll 
 1665 go to the hardware store this afternoon 
 1666 and see if they have seeds great this 
 1667 attic is so creepy 
 1668 yeah we haven't been up here in forever 
 1669 there are so many cobwebs 
 1670 yeah i think that might be a squirrel's 
 1671 nest over there 
 1672 oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 1673 well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 1674 i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 1675 don't you think that could be the 
 1676 squirrels 
 1677 yeah probably i think we should get this 
 1678 place cleaned up so we can use it 
 1679 yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 1680 hey when was the last time we went on a 
 1681 holiday gosh 
 1682 i don't remember was it two years ago 
 1683 when we went to the beach 
 1684 i guess so i didn't realize so much time 
 1685 had passed 
 1686 i know so do you think it's time for 
 1687 another trip 
 1688 absolutely i think i can get two weeks 
 1689 off work 
 1690 same here i think i have some days saved 
 1691 up great 
 1692 all we have to do is make some plans 
 1693 yeah why don't we sit down tonight and 
 1694 talk about it 
 1695 okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 1696 sites today 
 1697 so will i okay so i checked out some 
 1698 holiday options 
 1699 me too i think we should go to the 
 1700 mountains i was thinking the same thing 
 1701 yes we could do hiking and maybe go 
 1702 somewhere with hot springs 
 1703 i love that idea great me too so did you 
 1704 find any hotels you liked 
 1705 i actually did wonderful yeah i found a 
 1706 place that has a spa 
 1707 and is it really expensive i think we 
 1708 can afford it 
 1709 i'll call to make reservations tomorrow 
 1710 hello 
 1711 travel agency how can i help you yes i'm 
 1712 looking to book a room for two weeks 
 1713 when will you be visiting do you have 
 1714 availability next month 
 1715 yes we do the last two weeks are open 
 1716 great i need one room for two people and 
 1717 would you like twin beds or a queen size

 1724 you able to make a hotel reservation 
 1725 yes we have a room for two weeks next 
 1726 month that's great

 1728 we should drive oh i guess it's not too 
 1729 far 
 1730 it's about a seven hour drive right yeah 
 1731 and then we could save on renting a car 
 1732 while we're there 
 1733 that's very true we should get the car 
 1734 tuned up before we go 
 1735 that's a really good idea we don't want 
 1736 any car trouble on the way 
 1737 yeah i can get that done after work 
 1738 tomorrow 
 1739 thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 1740 next week

 1744 about what you're going to bring 
 1745 not at all me neither okay let's think 
 1746 we'll need hiking boots

 2149 do you think it's gotten lumpy yeah my 
 2150 back has been hurting lately 
 2151 hmm mine too should we go to the 
 2152 mattress store today

 2168 work me too 
 2169 see you tonight hey do you want to watch 
 2170 some tv 
 2171 yeah but i think we should move the tv 
 2172 to that wall over there 
 2173 why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 2174 i know 
 2175 but i just think it would look better 
 2176 over there all right but we have to move 
 2177 the coffee table too okay 
 2178 let's put the couch over on that side of 
 2179 the room and we can put the coffee table 
 2180 right here 
 2181 hmm and what about the bookshelf i know 
 2182 we can put it on that wall 
 2183 okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 2184 tv 
 2185 after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 2186 let's watch one show 
 2187 great let's watch friends i think we 
 2188 should have a dinner party 
 2189 that's a great idea we could have about 
 2190 eight people 
 2191 yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 2192 i think the table fits six 
 2193 but we can add an extension to it okay 
 2194 and maybe we should change the lighting 
 2195 in the dining room 
 2196 yeah maybe we should buy some new lamps 
 2197 for the corners of the room 
 2198 and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 2199 looks nice still 
 2200 i think so but i could pick up a new one 
 2201 tomorrow we should think about the food 
 2202 should we hire a catering company that's 
 2203 a really good idea 
 2204 how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 2205 friend anne has a company 
 2206 i'll ask her if she's free sounds good 
 2207 i think we should redecorate this 
 2208 basement really what do you want to use 
 2209 it for 
 2210 well i was thinking about turning it 
 2211 into an artist's studio that's a nice 
 2212 idea 
 2213 are you thinking of painting again yeah 
 2214 and there's all this room down here 
 2215 now that we're down here do you think we 
 2216 need a new water heater 
 2217 yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 2218 we've redone it all right 
 2219 i'll look into that first great and i'll 
 2220 start thinking about the design for the 
 2221 studio 
 2222 i think i could teach classes down here 
 2223 too that's a nice idea 
 2224 yeah i was thinking about giving art 
 2225 classes to the neighborhood kids 
 2226 i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 2227 clean out this garage 
 2228 i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 2229 since when did we get so much stuff 
 2230 i don't know like these skis when was 
 2231 the last time we used these 
 2232 maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 2233 i forgot all about that we should have a 
 2234 garage sale that's such a good idea 
 2235 we can make some money and clear this 
 2236 place out exactly 
 2237 should we do it on saturday yeah i'll go 
 2238 print out some flyers 
 2239 i really think we need new desks in here 
 2240 yeah we do so much work in here 
 2241 that it'd be worth it okay let's go 
 2242 shopping later this week 
 2243 great okay i really need to get some 
 2244 work done now 
 2245 all right i'll just sit on the couch 
 2246 here okay 
 2247 you know now that i look into it the 
 2248 study could use a new couch too 
 2249 you're right okay i'll let you get to 
 2250 work okay thanks 
 2251 do you mind plugging my laptop in sure 
 2252 thanks 
 2253 and have you seen my cell phone yeah 
 2254 it's on the shelf here 
 2255 i'll get it for you thanks i love 
 2256 how much sun we get out here on the 
 2257 porch oh me too 
 2258 you know what would be nice what a porch 
 2259 swing 
 2260 yes and i think we could use a few more 
 2261 plants out here 
 2262 you're right maybe some more flowers 
 2263 yeah and i was thinking we could plant 
 2264 some tomatoes 
 2265 too i love that idea i'll go to the 
 2266 hardware store this afternoon 
 2267 and see if they have seeds great this 
 2268 attic is so 
 2269 creepy yeah we haven't been up here in 
 2270 forever 
 2271 there are so many cobwebs yeah i think 
 2272 that might be a squirrel's nest over 
 2273 there 
 2274 oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 2275 well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 2276 i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 2277 don't you think that could be the 
 2278 squirrels 
 2279 yeah probably i think we should get this 
 2280 place cleaned up so we can use it 
 2281 yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 2282 hey when was the last time we went on a 
 2283 holiday gosh 
 2284 i don't remember was it two years ago 
 2285 when we went to the beach 
 2286 i guess so i didn't realize so much time 
 2287 had passed 
 2288 i know so do you think it's time for 
 2289 another trip 
 2290 absolutely i think i can get two weeks 
 2291 off work 
 2292 same here i think i have some days saved 
 2293 up great 
 2294 all we have to do is make some plans 
 2295 yeah why don't we sit down tonight and 
 2296 talk about it 
 2297 okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 2298 sites today 
 2299 so will i okay so i checked out some 
 2300 holiday 
 2301 options me too i think we should go to 
 2302 the mountains 
 2303 i was thinking the same thing yes we 
 2304 could do hiking 
 2305 and maybe go somewhere with hot springs 
 2306 i love that idea 
 2307 great me too so did you find any hotels 
 2308 you liked 
 2309 i actually did wonderful yeah i found a 
 2310 place that has a spa 
 2311 and is it really expensive i think we 
 2312 can afford it 
 2313 i'll call to make reservations tomorrow 
 2314 hello 
 2315 travel agency how can i help you yes i'm 
 2316 looking to book a room for two weeks 
 2317 when will you be visiting do you have 
 2318 availability next month 
 2319 yes we do the last two weeks are open 
 2320 great i need one room for two people and 
 2321 would you like twin beds or a queen

 2327 you able to make a hotel reservation 
 2328 yes we have a room for two weeks next 
 2329 month that's great 
 2330 we should book a flight i thought maybe 
 2331 we should drive oh 
 2332 i guess it's not too far it's about a 
 2333 seven hour drive right 
 2334 yeah and then we could save on renting a 
 2335 car while we're there 
 2336 that's very true we should get the car 
 2337 tuned up before we go 
 2338 that's a really good idea we don't want 
 2339 any car trouble on the way 
 2340 yeah i can get that done after work 
 2341 tomorrow 
 2342 thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 2343 next week

 2347 about what you're going to bring

 2744 yeah my back has been hurting lately 
 2745 hmm mine too should we go to the 
 2746 mattress store today 
 2747 let's do it i'll get our clothes from 
 2748 the closet 
 2749 hello are you in there yeah i'll just be 
 2750 one more minute 
 2751 okay but i really need to take a shower 
 2752 all right 
 2753 i'm just brushing my teeth okay i'll 
 2754 wait all right i'm done 
 2755 it's all yours thanks wait where did you 
 2756 put the towels 
 2757 they're in the closet oh yeah thanks and 
 2758 do you know if we have new shampoo 
 2759 no but there's a little bit left in the 
 2760 bottle thanks okay i have to hurry i 
 2761 have to get to work 
 2762 me too see you tonight hey do you want 
 2763 to watch some tv 
 2764 yeah but i think we should move the tv 
 2765 to that wall over there 
 2766 why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 2767 i know 
 2768 but i just think it would look better 
 2769 over there all right but we have to move 
 2770 the coffee table 
 2771 too okay let's put the couch over on 
 2772 that side of the room 
 2773 and we can put the coffee table right 
 2774 here hmm 
 2775 and what about the bookshelf i know we 
 2776 can put it on that wall 
 2777 okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 2778 tv 
 2779 after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 2780 let's watch one show 
 2781 great let's watch friends i think we 
 2782 should have a dinner party 
 2783 that's a great idea we could have about 
 2784 eight people 
 2785 yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 2786 i think the table fits six 
 2787 but we can add an extension to it okay 
 2788 and maybe we should change the lighting 
 2789 in the dining room 
 2790 yeah maybe we should buy some new lamps 
 2791 for the corners of the room 
 2792 and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 2793 looks nice still 
 2794 i think so but i could pick up a new one 
 2795 tomorrow we should think about the food 
 2796 should we hire a catering company that's 
 2797 a really good idea 
 2798 how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 2799 friend anne has a company i'll ask her 
 2800 if she's free 
 2801 sounds good i think we should redecorate 
 2802 this basement 
 2803 really what do you want to use it for 
 2804 well i was thinking about turning it 
 2805 into an artist studio that's a nice idea 
 2806 are you thinking of painting again yeah 
 2807 and there's all this room down here 
 2808 now that we're down here do you think we 
 2809 need a new water heater 
 2810 yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 2811 we've redone it all right 
 2812 i'll look into that first great and i'll 
 2813 start thinking about the design for the 
 2814 studio i think i could teach classes 
 2815 down here too 
 2816 that's a nice idea yeah i was thinking 
 2817 about giving art classes to the 
 2818 neighborhood kids 
 2819 i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 2820 clean out this garage 
 2821 i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 2822 since when did we get so much stuff 
 2823 i don't know like these skis when was 
 2824 the last time we used these 
 2825 maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 2826 i forgot all about that we should have a 
 2827 garage sale 
 2828 that's such a good idea we can make some 
 2829 money and clear this place out 
 2830 exactly should we do it on saturday yeah 
 2831 i'll go print out some flyers i really 
 2832 think we need new desks in here 
 2833 yeah we do so much work in here that 
 2834 it'd be worth it 
 2835 okay let's go shopping later this week 
 2836 great okay 
 2837 i really need to get some work done now 
 2838 all right i'll just sit on the couch 
 2839 here 
 2840 okay you know now that i look into it 
 2841 the study could use a new couch too 
 2842 you're right okay i'll let you get to 
 2843 work okay thanks 
 2844 do you mind plugging my laptop in sure 
 2845 thanks 
 2846 and have you seen my cell phone yeah 
 2847 it's on the shelf here 
 2848 i'll get it for you thanks i 
 2849 love how much sun we get out here on the 
 2850 porch 
 2851 oh me too you know what would be nice 
 2852 what a porch swing 
 2853 yes and i think we could use a few more 
 2854 plants out here 
 2855 you're right maybe some more flowers 
 2856 yeah and i was thinking we could plant 
 2857 some tomatoes 
 2858 too i love that idea i'll go to the 
 2859 hardware store this afternoon 
 2860 and see if they have seats great this 
 2861 attic is so creepy 
 2862 yeah we haven't been up here in forever 
 2863 there are so many cobwebs 
 2864 yeah i think that might be a squirrel's 
 2865 nest over there 
 2866 oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 2867 well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 2868 i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 2869 don't you think that could be the 
 2870 squirrels 
 2871 yeah probably i think we should get this 
 2872 place cleaned up so we can use it 
 2873 yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 2874 hey when was the last time we went on a 
 2875 holiday gosh i don't remember 
 2876 was it two years ago when we went to the 
 2877 beach i guess so 
 2878 i didn't realize so much time had passed 
 2879 i know 
 2880 so do you think it's time for another 
 2881 trip absolutely 
 2882 i think i can get two weeks off work 
 2883 same here i think i have some days saved 
 2884 up 
 2885 great all we have to do is make some 
 2886 plans yeah why don't we sit down tonight 
 2887 and talk about it 
 2888 okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 2889 sites today 
 2890 so will i okay so i checked out some 
 2891 holiday options 
 2892 me too i think we should go to the 
 2893 mountains i was thinking the same thing 
 2894 yes we could do hiking and maybe go 
 2895 somewhere with hot springs 
 2896 i love that idea great me too so 
 2897 did you find any hotels you liked i 
 2898 actually did 
 2899 wonderful yeah i found a place that has 
 2900 a spa 
 2901 and is it really expensive i think we 
 2902 can afford it 
 2903 i'll call to make reservations tomorrow 
 2904 hello 
 2905 travel agency how can i help you yes i'm 
 2906 looking to book a room for two weeks 
 2907 when will you be visiting do you have 
 2908 availability next month 
 2909 yes we do the last two weeks are open 
 2910 great 
 2911 i need one room for two people and would 
 2912 you like twin beds or a queen size bed a 
 2913 queen sized 
 2914 all right and do you have any other 
 2915 questions yes 
 2916 is the use of the spa included yes it is 
 2917 that's great we can't wait to go were 
 2918 you able to make a hotel reservation yes 
 2919 we have a room for two weeks next month 
 2920 that's great we should book a flight 
 2921 i thought maybe we should drive oh i 
 2922 guess it's not too far 
 2923 it's about a seven hour drive right yeah 
 2924 and then we could save on renting a car 
 2925 while we're there 
 2926 that's very true we should get the car 
 2927 tuned up before we go 
 2928 that's a really good idea we don't want 
 2929 any car trouble on the way 
 2930 yeah i can get that done after work 
 2931 tomorrow 
 2932 thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 2933 next week 
 2934 yeah so we're leaving in three days i 
 2935 know i'm so excited 
 2936 me too have you thought about what 
 2937 you're going to bring not at all 
 2938 me neither okay let's think we'll need 
 2939 hiking boots 
 2940 and swimsuits for the pool and we should 
 2941 bring bug spray 
 2942 yeah and sunscreen don't forget about 
 2943 our water bottles 
 2944 yeah and clothes for cool weather right

 2949 car great because we'll need the gps to 
 2950 get there

 2955 great we should stop at the gas station 
 2956 on the way out of town yeah and we can 
 2957 pick up some snacks and coffee there

 2961 beautiful waterfall nearby

 3332 thanks oh it's a beautiful day it really 
 3333 is how did you sleep 
 3334 pretty good but i think we may need a 
 3335 new mattress 
 3336 really do you think it's gotten lumpy 
 3337 yeah my back has been hurting lately 
 3338 hmm mine too should we go to the 
 3339 mattress store today 
 3340 let's do it i'll get our clothes from 
 3341 the closet 
 3342 hello are you in there yeah i'll just be

 3347 wait all right i'm done 
 3348 it's all yours thanks wait where did you 
 3349 put the towels 
 3350 they're in the closet oh yeah thanks and 
 3351 do you know if we have new shampoo 
 3352 no but there's a little bit left in the 
 3353 bottle thanks 
 3354 okay i have to hurry i have to get to 
 3355 work me too 
 3356 see you tonight hey do you want to watch 
 3357 some tv 
 3358 yeah but i think we should move the tv 
 3359 to that wall over there 
 3360 why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 3361 i know 
 3362 but i just think it would look better 
 3363 over there all right but we have to move 
 3364 the coffee table too 
 3365 okay let's put the couch over on that 
 3366 side of the room 
 3367 and we can put the coffee table right 
 3368 here hmm 
 3369 and what about the bookshelf i know we 
 3370 can put it on that wall 
 3371 okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 3372 tv 
 3373 after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 3374 let's watch one show 
 3375 great let's watch friends i think we 
 3376 should have a dinner party 
 3377 that's a great idea we could have about 
 3378 eight people 
 3379 yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 3380 i think the table fits six 
 3381 but we can add an extension to it okay 
 3382 and maybe we should change the lighting 
 3383 in the dining room 
 3384 yeah maybe we should buy some new lamps 
 3385 for the corners of the room 
 3386 and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 3387 looks nice still 
 3388 i think so but i could pick up a new one 
 3389 tomorrow we should think about the food 
 3390 should we hire a catering company that's 
 3391 a really good idea 
 3392 how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 3393 friend anne has a company 
 3394 i'll ask her if she's free sounds good 
 3395 i think we should redecorate this 
 3396 basement really 
 3397 what do you want to use it for well i 
 3398 was thinking about turning it 
 3399 into an artist studio that's a nice idea 
 3400 are you thinking of painting again 
 3401 yeah and there's all this room down here 
 3402 now that we're down here 
 3403 do you think we need a new water heater 
 3404 yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 3405 we've redone it 
 3406 all right i'll look into that first 
 3407 great and i'll start thinking about the 
 3408 design for the studio 
 3409 i think i could teach classes down here 
 3410 too that's a nice idea 
 3411 yeah i was thinking about giving art 
 3412 classes to the neighborhood kids 
 3413 i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 3414 clean out this garage 
 3415 i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 3416 since when did we get so much stuff 
 3417 i don't know like these skis when was 
 3418 the last time we used these 
 3419 maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 3420 i forgot all about that we should have a 
 3421 garage sale 
 3422 that's such a good idea we can make some 
 3423 money and clear this place out 
 3424 exactly should we do it on saturday yeah 
 3425 i'll go print 
 3426 out some flyers i really think we need 
 3427 new desks in here 
 3428 yeah we do so much work in here that 
 3429 it'd be worth it 
 3430 okay let's go shopping later this week 
 3431 great okay 
 3432 i really need to get some work done now 
 3433 all right i'll just sit on the couch 
 3434 here 
 3435 okay you know now that i look into it 
 3436 the study could use a new couch too 
 3437 you're right okay i'll let you get to 
 3438 work okay thanks 
 3439 do you mind plugging my laptop in sure 
 3440 thanks 
 3441 and have you seen my cell phone yeah 
 3442 it's on the shelf here i'll get it for 
 3443 you 
 3444 thanks i love how much sun we get out 
 3445 here on the porch 
 3446 oh me too you know what would be nice 
 3447 what a porch swing 
 3448 yes and i think we could use a few more 
 3449 plants out here 
 3450 you're right maybe some more flowers 
 3451 yeah and i was thinking we could plant 
 3452 some tomatoes 
 3453 too i love that idea i'll go to the 
 3454 hardware store this afternoon 
 3455 and see if they have seeds great this 
 3456 attic is so creepy 
 3457 yeah we haven't been up here in forever 
 3458 there are so many cobwebs 
 3459 yeah i think that might be a squirrel's 
 3460 nest over there 
 3461 oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 3462 well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 3463 i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 3464 don't you think that could be the 
 3465 squirrels 
 3466 yeah probably i think we should get this 
 3467 place cleaned up so we can use it 
 3468 yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 3469 hey when was the last time we went on a 
 3470 holiday gosh 
 3471 i don't remember was it two years ago 
 3472 when we went to the beach 
 3473 i guess so i didn't realize so much time 
 3474 had passed 
 3475 i know so do you think it's time for 
 3476 another trip 
 3477 absolutely i think i can get two weeks 
 3478 off work 
 3479 same here i think i have some days saved 
 3480 up great 
 3481 all we have to do is make some plans 
 3482 yeah why don't we sit down tonight and 
 3483 talk about it 
 3484 okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 3485 sites today 
 3486 so will i okay so i checked out some 
 3487 holiday options 
 3488 me too i think we should go to the 
 3489 mountains i was thinking the same thing 
 3490 yes we could do hiking and maybe go 
 3491 somewhere with hot springs 
 3492 i love that idea great me too so did you 
 3493 find 
 3494 any hotels you liked i actually did 
 3495 wonderful 
 3496 yeah i found a place that has a spa and 
 3497 is it really expensive 
 3498 i think we can afford it i'll call to 
 3499 make reservations tomorrow 
 3500 hello travel agency how can i help you 
 3501 yes 
 3502 i'm looking to book a room for two weeks 
 3503 when will you be visiting 
 3504 do you have availability next month yes 
 3505 we do the last two weeks 
 3506 are open great i need one room for two 
 3507 people 
 3508 and would you like twin beds or a queen 
 3509 size bed a queen sized 
 3510 all right and do you have any other 
 3511 questions yes 
 3512 is the use of the spa included yes it is 
 3513 that's great we can't wait to go were 
 3514 you able to make a hotel reservation 
 3515 yes we have a room for two weeks next 
 3516 month that's great 
 3517 we should book a flight i thought maybe 
 3518 we should drive oh i guess it's not too 
 3519 far 
 3520 it's about a seven hour drive right yeah 
 3521 and then we could save on renting a car 
 3522 while we're there 
 3523 that's very true we should get the car 
 3524 tuned up before we go 
 3525 that's a really good idea we don't want 
 3526 any car trouble on the way 
 3527 yeah i can get that done after work 
 3528 tomorrow 
 3529 thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 3530 next week 
 3531 yeah so we're leaving in three days i 
 3532 know 
 3533 i'm so excited me too have you thought 
 3534 about what you're going to bring 
 3535 not at all me neither okay let's think 
 3536 we'll need hiking boots 
 3537 and swimsuits for the pool and we should 
 3538 bring bug spray 
 3539 yeah and sunscreen don't forget about 
 3540 our water bottles 
 3541 yeah and clothes for cool weather right 
 3542 okay

 3546 chargers yeah

 3548 great because we'll need the gps to get 
 3549 there

 3560 it says here that there's a beautiful 
 3561 waterfall nearby don't you want to go 
 3562 ahead and go to the hotel

 3935 oh it's a beautiful day 
 3936 it really is how did you sleep pretty 
 3937 good 
 3938 but i think we may need a new mattress 
 3939 really 
 3940 do you think it's gotten lumpy yeah my 
 3941 back has been hurting lately 
 3942 hmm mine too should we go to the 
 3943 mattress store today let's do it i'll 
 3944 get our clothes from the closet 
 3945 hello are you in there yeah i'll just be 
 3946 one more minute 
 3947 okay but i really need to take a shower 
 3948 all right 
 3949 i'm just brushing my teeth okay i'll 
 3950 wait all right i'm done 
 3951 it's all yours thanks wait where did you 
 3952 put the towels 
 3953 they're in the closet oh yeah thanks and 
 3954 do you know if we have new shampoo 
 3955 no but there's a little bit left in the 
 3956 bottle thanks 
 3957 okay i have to hurry i have to get to 
 3958 work me too 
 3959 see you tonight hey do you want to watch 
 3960 some tv 
 3961 yeah but i think we should move the tv 
 3962 to that wall over there 
 3963 why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 3964 i know 
 3965 but i just think it would look better 
 3966 over there all right but we have to move 
 3967 the coffee table too 
 3968 okay let's put the couch over on that 
 3969 side of the room 
 3970 and we can put the coffee table right 
 3971 here hmm 
 3972 and what about the bookshelf i know we 
 3973 can put it on that wall 
 3974 okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 3975 tv 
 3976 after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 3977 let's watch one show 
 3978 great let's watch friends i think we 
 3979 should have a dinner party 
 3980 that's a great idea we could have about 
 3981 eight people 
 3982 yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 3983 i think the table fits six 
 3984 but we can add an extension to it okay 
 3985 and maybe we should change the lighting 
 3986 in the dining room 
 3987 yeah maybe we should buy some new lamps 
 3988 for the corners of the room 
 3989 and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 3990 looks nice still 
 3991 i think so but i could pick up a new one 
 3992 tomorrow we should think about the food 
 3993 should we hire a catering company that's 
 3994 a really good idea 
 3995 how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 3996 friend anne has a company 
 3997 i'll ask her if she's free sounds good 
 3998 i think we should redecorate this 
 3999 basement really what do you want to use 
 4000 it for 
 4001 well i was thinking about turning it 
 4002 into an artist studio that's a nice idea 
 4003 are you thinking of painting again yeah 
 4004 and there's all this room down here 
 4005 now that we're down here do you think we 
 4006 need a new water heater 
 4007 yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 4008 we've redone it all right 
 4009 i'll look into that first great and i'll 
 4010 start thinking about the design 
 4011 for the studio i think i could teach 
 4012 classes down here too 
 4013 that's a nice idea yeah i was thinking 
 4014 about giving art classes to the 
 4015 neighborhood kids 
 4016 i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 4017 clean out this garage 
 4018 i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 4019 since when did we get so much stuff 
 4020 i don't know like these skis when was 
 4021 the last time we used these 
 4022 maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 4023 i forgot all about that we should have a 
 4024 garage sale 
 4025 that's such a good idea we can make some 
 4026 money and clear this place out 
 4027 exactly should we do it on saturday yeah 
 4028 i'll go print out some flyers i really 
 4029 think we need new desks in here 
 4030 yeah we do so much work in here that 
 4031 it'd be worth it 
 4032 okay let's go shopping later this week 
 4033 great okay 
 4034 i really need to get some work done now 
 4035 all right i'll just sit on the couch 
 4036 here 
 4037 okay you know now that i look into it 
 4038 the study could use a new couch too 
 4039 you're right okay i'll let you get to 
 4040 work okay thanks 
 4041 do you mind plugging my laptop in sure 
 4042 thanks 
 4043 and have you seen my cell phone yeah 
 4044 it's on this shelf here 
 4045 i'll get it for you thanks i 
 4046 love how much sun we get out here on the 
 4047 porch 
 4048 oh me too you know what would be nice 
 4049 what a porch swing 
 4050 yes and i think we could use a few more 
 4051 plants out here 
 4052 you're right maybe some more flowers 
 4053 yeah and i was thinking we could plant 
 4054 some tomatoes 
 4055 too i love that idea i'll go to the 
 4056 hardware store this afternoon 
 4057 and see if they have seeds great this 
 4058 attic is so 
 4059 creepy yeah we haven't been up here in 
 4060 forever 
 4061 there are so many cobwebs yeah i think 
 4062 that might be a squirrel's nest over 
 4063 there 
 4064 oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 4065 well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 4066 i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 4067 don't you think that could be the 
 4068 squirrels 
 4069 yeah probably i think we should get this 
 4070 place cleaned up so we can use it 
 4071 yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 4072 hey when was the last time we went on a 
 4073 holiday gosh 
 4074 i don't remember was it two years ago 
 4075 when we went to the beach 
 4076 i guess so i didn't realize so much time 
 4077 had passed 
 4078 i know so do you think it's time for 
 4079 another trip 
 4080 absolutely i think i can get two weeks 
 4081 off work 
 4082 same here i think i have some days saved 
 4083 up great 
 4084 all we have to do is make some plans 
 4085 yeah why don't we sit down tonight and 
 4086 talk about it 
 4087 okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 4088 sites today 
 4089 so will i okay so i checked out some 
 4090 holiday options 
 4091 me too i think we should go to the 
 4092 mountains i was thinking the same thing 
 4093 yes we could do hiking and maybe go 
 4094 somewhere with hot springs 
 4095 i love that idea great me too so did you 
 4096 find any hotels you liked 
 4097 i actually did wonderful yeah i found a 
 4098 place that has a spa 
 4099 and is it really expensive i think we 
 4100 can afford it 
 4101 i'll call to make reservations tomorrow 
 4102 hello 
 4103 travel agency how can i help you yes i'm 
 4104 looking to book a room for two weeks 
 4105 when will you be visiting do you have 
 4106 availability next month 
 4107 yes we do the last two weeks are open 
 4108 great i need one room for two people and 
 4109 would you like twin beds or a queen size 
 4110 bed 
 4111 a queen sized all right and do you have 
 4112 any other questions

 4116 you able to make a hotel reservation 
 4117 yes we have a room for two weeks next 
 4118 month that's great 
 4119 we should book a flight i thought maybe 
 4120 we should drive oh 
 4121 i guess it's not too far it's about a 
 4122 seven hour drive right 
 4123 yeah and then we could save on renting a 
 4124 car while we're there 
 4125 that's very true we should get the car 
 4126 tuned up before we go 
 4127 that's a really good idea we don't want 
 4128 any car trouble on the way 
 4129 yeah i can get that done after work 
 4130 tomorrow 
 4131 thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 4132 next week

 4532 oh it's a beautiful day it really is 
 4533 how did you sleep pretty good but i 
 4534 think we may need a new mattress 
 4535 really do you think it's gotten lumpy 
 4536 yeah my back has been hurting lately 
 4537 hmm mine too should we go to the 
 4538 mattress store today 
 4539 let's do it i'll get our clothes from 
 4540 the closet 
 4541 hello are you in there yeah i'll just be

 4549 they're in the closet oh yeah thanks and 
 4550 do you know if we have new shampoo 
 4551 no but there's a little bit left in the 
 4552 bottle thanks okay 
 4553 i have to hurry i have to get to work me 
 4554 too see you tonight 
 4555 hey do you want to watch some tv yeah 
 4556 but i think we should move the tv to 
 4557 that wall over there 
 4558 why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 4559 i know 
 4560 but i just think it would look better 
 4561 over there all right but we have to move 
 4562 the coffee table too 
 4563 okay let's put the couch over on that 
 4564 side of the room 
 4565 and we can put the coffee table right 
 4566 here hmm 
 4567 and what about the bookshelf i know we 
 4568 can put it on that wall 
 4569 okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 4570 tv 
 4571 after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 4572 let's watch one show 
 4573 great let's watch friends i think we 
 4574 should have a dinner party 
 4575 that's a great idea we could have about 
 4576 eight people 
 4577 yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 4578 i think the table fits six 
 4579 but we can add an extension to it okay 
 4580 and maybe we should change the lighting 
 4581 in the dining room 
 4582 yeah maybe we should buy some new lamps 
 4583 for the corners of the room 
 4584 and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 4585 looks nice still 
 4586 i think so but i could pick up a new one 
 4587 tomorrow we should think about the food 
 4588 should we hire a catering company that's 
 4589 a really good idea 
 4590 how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 4591 friend 
 4592 anne has a company i'll ask her if she's 
 4593 free sounds good 
 4594 i think we should redecorate this 
 4595 basement really what do you want to use 
 4596 it for 
 4597 well i was thinking about turning it 
 4598 into an artist studio that's a nice idea 
 4599 are you thinking of painting again yeah 
 4600 and there's all this room down here 
 4601 now that we're down here do you think we 
 4602 need a new water heater 
 4603 yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 4604 we've redone it all right 
 4605 i'll look into that first great and i'll 
 4606 start thinking about the design for the 
 4607 studio 
 4608 i think i could teach classes down here 
 4609 too that's a nice idea 
 4610 yeah i was thinking about giving art 
 4611 classes to the neighborhood kids 
 4612 i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 4613 clean out this garage 
 4614 i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 4615 since when did we get so much stuff 
 4616 i don't know like these skis when was 
 4617 the last time we used these 
 4618 maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 4619 i forgot all about that we should have a 
 4620 garage sale 
 4621 that's such a good idea we can make some 
 4622 money and clear this place out 
 4623 exactly should we do it on saturday yeah 
 4624 i'll go print out some flyers i really 
 4625 think we need new desks in here 
 4626 yeah we do so much work in here that 
 4627 it'd be worth it 
 4628 okay let's go shopping later this week 
 4629 great okay 
 4630 i really need to get some work done now 
 4631 all right i'll just sit on the couch 
 4632 here 
 4633 okay you know now that i look into it 
 4634 the study could use a new couch too 
 4635 you're right okay i'll let you get to 
 4636 work okay thanks 
 4637 do you mind plugging my laptop in sure 
 4638 thanks 
 4639 and have you seen my cell phone yeah 
 4640 it's on the shelf here 
 4641 i'll get it for you thanks i 
 4642 love how much sun we get out here on the 
 4643 porch 
 4644 oh me too you know what would be nice 
 4645 what a porch swing 
 4646 yes and i think we could use a few more 
 4647 plants out here 
 4648 you're right maybe some more flowers 
 4649 yeah and i was thinking we could plant 
 4650 some tomatoes 
 4651 too i love that idea i'll go to the 
 4652 hardware store this afternoon 
 4653 and see if they have seeds great this 
 4654 attic is so creepy 
 4655 yeah we haven't been up here in forever 
 4656 there are so many cobwebs 
 4657 yeah i think that might be a squirrel's 
 4658 nest over there 
 4659 oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 4660 well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 4661 i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 4662 don't you think that could be the 
 4663 squirrels 
 4664 yeah probably i think we should get this 
 4665 place cleaned up so we can use it 
 4666 yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 4667 hey when was the last time we went on a 
 4668 holiday gosh 
 4669 i don't remember was it two years ago 
 4670 when we went to the beach 
 4671 i guess so i didn't realize so much time 
 4672 had passed 
 4673 i know so do you think it's time for 
 4674 another trip 
 4675 absolutely i think i can get two weeks 
 4676 off work 
 4677 same here i think i have some days saved 
 4678 up 
 4679 great all we have to do is make some 
 4680 plans yeah why don't we sit down tonight 
 4681 and talk about it 
 4682 okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 4683 sites today 
 4684 so will i okay so i checked out some 
 4685 holiday options 
 4686 me too i think we should go to the 
 4687 mountains i was thinking the same thing 
 4688 yes we could do hiking and maybe go 
 4689 somewhere with hot springs 
 4690 i love that idea great me too so did you 
 4691 find any hotels you liked 
 4692 i actually did wonderful yeah i found a 
 4693 place that has a spa 
 4694 and is it really expensive i think we 
 4695 can afford it 
 4696 i'll call to make reservations tomorrow 
 4697 hello 
 4698 travel agency how can i help you yes i'm 
 4699 looking to book a room for two weeks 
 4700 when will you be visiting do you have 
 4701 availability next month 
 4702 yes we do the last two weeks are open 
 4703 great 
 4704 i need one room for two people and would 
 4705 you like twin beds or a queen size bed a 
 4706 queen sized 
 4707 all right and do you have any other 
 4708 questions yes 
 4709 is the use of the spa included yes it is 
 4710 that's great we can't wait to go were 
 4711 you 
 4712 able to make a hotel reservation yes we 
 4713 have a room for two weeks next month 
 4714 that's great we should book a flight i 
 4715 thought maybe we should drive 
 4716 oh i guess it's not too far it's about a 
 4717 seven hour drive right 
 4718 yeah and then we could save on renting a 
 4719 car while we're there 
 4720 that's very true we should get the car 
 4721 tuned up before we go 
 4722 that's a really good idea we don't want 
 4723 any car trouble on the way 
 4724 yeah i can get that done after work 
 4725 tomorrow 
 4726 thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 4727 next week

 4729 know i'm so excited 
 4730 me too have you thought about what 
 4731 you're going to bring not at all 
 4732 me neither okay let's think we'll need 
 4733 hiking boots 
 4734 and swimsuits for the pool and we should 
 4735 bring bug spray

 4737 our water bottles

 5129 think we may need a new mattress 
 5130 really do you think it's gotten lumpy 
 5131 yeah my back has been hurting lately 
 5132 hmm mine too should we go to the 
 5133 mattress store today 
 5134 let's do it i'll get our clothes from 
 5135 the closet 
 5136 hello are you in there yeah i'll just be

 5144 they're in the closet oh yeah thanks and 
 5145 do you know if we have new shampoo 
 5146 no but there's a little bit left in the 
 5147 bottle thanks 
 5148 okay i have to hurry i have to get to 
 5149 work me too 
 5150 see you tonight hey do you want to watch 
 5151 some tv 
 5152 yeah but i think we should move the tv 
 5153 to that wall over there 
 5154 why we'd have to move the couch too yeah 
 5155 i know 
 5156 but i just think it would look better 
 5157 over there all right but we have to move 
 5158 the coffee table too 
 5159 okay let's put the couch over on that 
 5160 side of the room 
 5161 and we can put the coffee table right 
 5162 here hmm 
 5163 and what about the bookshelf i know we 
 5164 can put it on that wall 
 5165 okay i like it there now ready to watch 
 5166 tv 
 5167 after all that i'm pretty tired but 
 5168 let's watch one show 
 5169 great let's watch friends i think we 
 5170 should have a dinner party 
 5171 that's a great idea we could have about 
 5172 eight people 
 5173 yeah i think they'd all fit at the table 
 5174 i think the table fits six 
 5175 but we can add an extension to it okay 
 5176 and maybe we should change the lighting 
 5177 in the dining room 
 5178 yeah maybe we should buy some new lamps 
 5179 for the corners of the room 
 5180 and do you think the tablecloth we have 
 5181 looks nice still 
 5182 i think so but i could pick up a new one 
 5183 tomorrow we should think about the food 
 5184 should we hire a catering company that's 
 5185 a really good idea 
 5186 how about mediterranean food perfect my 
 5187 friend anne has a company 
 5188 i'll ask her if she's free sounds good 
 5189 i think we should redecorate this 
 5190 basement really 
 5191 what do you want to use it for well i 
 5192 was thinking about turning it 
 5193 into an artist studio that's a nice idea 
 5194 are you thinking of painting again 
 5195 yeah and there's all this room down here 
 5196 now that we're down here 
 5197 do you think we need a new water heater 
 5198 yeah i wouldn't want it to burst after 
 5199 we've redone it 
 5200 all right i'll look into that first 
 5201 great and i'll start thinking about the 
 5202 design for the studio 
 5203 i think i could teach classes down here 
 5204 too that's a nice idea 
 5205 yeah i was thinking about giving art 
 5206 classes to the neighborhood kids 
 5207 i'm sure they'd love that we have got to 
 5208 clean out this garage 
 5209 i know the car doesn't even fit anymore 
 5210 since when did we get so much stuff 
 5211 i don't know like these skis when was 
 5212 the last time we used these 
 5213 maybe 15 years ago and this drum set wow 
 5214 i forgot all about that 
 5215 we should have a garage sale that's such 
 5216 a good idea 
 5217 we can make some money and clear this 
 5218 place out exactly 
 5219 should we do it on saturday yeah i'll go 
 5220 print out some flyers 
 5221 i really think we need new desks in here 
 5222 yeah we do so much work in here 
 5223 that it'd be worth it okay let's go 
 5224 shopping later this week 
 5225 great okay i really need to get some 
 5226 work done now all right 
 5227 i'll just sit on the couch here okay you 
 5228 know now that i look into it 
 5229 the study could use a new couch too 
 5230 you're right 
 5231 okay i'll let you get to work okay 
 5232 thanks do you mind plugging my laptop in 
 5233 sure thanks and have you seen my cell 
 5234 phone yeah it's on the shelf here i'll 
 5235 get it for you 
 5236 thanks i love how much sun we get out 
 5237 here on the porch 
 5238 oh me too you know what would be nice 
 5239 what a porch swing 
 5240 yes and i think we could use a few more 
 5241 plants out here you're right 
 5242 maybe some more flowers yeah and i was 
 5243 thinking we could plant some tomatoes 
 5244 too i love that idea i'll go to the 
 5245 hardware store this afternoon 
 5246 and see if they have seeds great this 
 5247 attic is so creepy yeah 
 5248 we haven't been up here in forever there 
 5249 are so many cobwebs 
 5250 yeah i think that might be a squirrel's 
 5251 nest over there 
 5252 oh wow do you think there are ghosts 
 5253 well maybe this is an old house yeah 
 5254 i hear noises up here at night sometimes 
 5255 don't you think that could be the 
 5256 squirrels 
 5257 yeah probably i think we should get this 
 5258 place cleaned up so we can use it 
 5259 yeah we can make a guest room up here 
 5260 hey when was the last time we went on a 
 5261 holiday gosh 
 5262 i don't remember was it two years ago 
 5263 when we went to the beach 
 5264 i guess so i didn't realize so much time 
 5265 had passed 
 5266 i know so do you think it's time for 
 5267 another trip 
 5268 absolutely i think i can get two weeks 
 5269 off work 
 5270 same here i think i have some days saved 
 5271 up 
 5272 great all we have to do is make some 
 5273 plans yeah why don't we sit down tonight 
 5274 and talk about it 
 5275 okay all right i'll look at some travel 
 5276 sites today 
 5277 so will i okay so i checked out some 
 5278 holiday options 
 5279 me too i think we should go to the 
 5280 mountains i was thinking the same thing 
 5281 yes we could do hiking and maybe go 
 5282 somewhere with hot springs 
 5283 i love that idea great me too so did you 
 5284 find 
 5285 any hotels you liked i actually did 
 5286 wonderful 
 5287 yeah i found a place that has a spa and 
 5288 is it really expensive 
 5289 i think we can afford it i'll call to 
 5290 make reservations tomorrow 
 5291 hello travel agency how can i help you 
 5292 yes 
 5293 i'm looking to book a room for two weeks 
 5294 when will you be visiting 
 5295 do you have availability next month yes 
 5296 we do the last two weeks 
 5297 are open great i need one room for two 
 5298 people 
 5299 and would you like twin beds or a queen 
 5300 size bed a queen sized 
 5301 all right and do you have any other 
 5302 questions yes 
 5303 is the use of the spa included yes it is 
 5304 that's great we can't wait to go were 
 5305 you able to make a hotel reservation 
 5306 yes we have a room for two weeks next 
 5307 month that's great 
 5308 we should book a flight i thought maybe 
 5309 we should drive oh i guess it's not too 
 5310 far 
 5311 it's about a seven hour drive right yeah 
 5312 and then we could save on renting a car 
 5313 while we're there 
 5314 that's very true we should get the car 
 5315 tuned up before we go 
 5316 that's a really good idea we don't want 
 5317 any car trouble on the way 
 5318 yeah i can get that done after work 
 5319 tomorrow 
 5320 thanks sure and will you get it washed 
 5321 next week

 5323 know 
 5324 i'm so excited me too have you thought 
 5325 about what you're going to bring 
 5326 not at all me neither okay let's think 
 5327 we'll need hiking boots 
 5328 and swimsuits for the pool and we should 
 5329 bring bug spray 
 5330 yeah and sunscreen don't forget about 
 5331 our water bottles 
 5332 yeah and clothes for cool weather right 
 5333 okay

 5337 chargers yeah 
 5338 here's the one we can plug into the car 
 5339 great because we'll need the gps to get 
 5340 there

 5344 locked up 
 5345 great we should stop at the gas station 
 5346 on the way out of town

 5348 coffee there sounds good

 5351 it says here that there's a beautiful 
 5352 waterfall nearby don't you want to go 
 5353 ahead and go to the hotel
