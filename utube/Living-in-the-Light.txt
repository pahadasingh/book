 Introduction the beginning of my journey 
 i have always had a burning desire to 
 understand how the universe works 
 what life is all about and the meaning 
 and purpose for which i am here 
 in red respect i can see that my entire 
 life has been devoted to my search for 
 truth and 
 understanding i was brought up in a very 
 intellectual 
 well-educated non-religious family my 
 parents were essentially atheists 
 and very early on i remember having the 
 attitude that a belief in god was a 
 human fabrication 
 a fantasy a superstition created to help 
 people feel better about the totally 
 unexplained 
 and unexplainable predicament we seem to 
 find ourselves in 
 human existence or any other kind of 
 existence 
 was simply an accident of nature and had 
 no particularly fathomable meaning 
 i preferred to admit that i didn't know 
 how we got here or why 
 rather than to adopt a simplistic 
 explanation merely to gain a sense of 
 security 
 i believe that truth was rational and 
 anything that couldn't be proved 
 scientifically didn't exist 
 i also felt somewhat condescending 
 toward people who were weak enough to 
 have to make up a god to believe 
 in the positive side of this upbringing 
 was that i didn't get a lot of the rigid 
 dogma and deeply negative 
 messages about right and wrong heaven 
 and hell and sin that so many people 
 receive in their early religious 
 training 
 on the other hand i had no conscious 
 concept or experience of the spiritual 
 dimension of life 
 and no answers for the questions i had 
 about the meaning and purpose of my life 
 my parents really wanted a child and 
 were very loving to me 
 unfortunately they were unable to work 
 out their own relationship and were 
 divorced when i was two years old 
 although i don't remember it clearly i 
 know this event had a major impact on my 
 life and affected my later patterns in 
 relationship 
 after the divorce i lived with my mother 
 who never remarried or had any other 
 children 
 my father did remarry and i often 
 visited my father and his other family 
 my mother developed a successful career 
 as a city planner in the days when there 
 were few women in that field 
 she dealt with the usual challenges of 
 single parenting 
 trying to balance the needs of her child 
 with the demands of her work 
 being the only child of living in the 
 light of working mother 
 i developed a strong sense of 
 responsibility and self-sufficiency 
 quite early 
 my mother is a very adventurous person 
 she loves to try new things 
 and for me she was a great role model of 
 fearlessness and pioneer spirit 
 she had been one of the first educated 
 american women in her generation to have 
 natural childbirth 
 i was the first baby her doctor had ever 
 delivered without an 
 anesthetic i was blessed with a very 
 fortunate birth 
 on september 30th 1948 at 9 10 p.m in 
 trenton 
 new jersey for all you astrologers my 
 mother loves to explore new places and 
 we traveled a lot when i was a child 
 all over the united states to the west 
 indies 
 mexico hawaii europe we also moved 
 frequently whenever my mother changed 
 jobs 
 until i was about 15 i had never lived 
 in one place 
 longer than two or three years my 
 mother's family had been quakers and we 
 still 
 used the plain language when speaking to 
 my grandmother 
 saying thee rather than you for the 
 quakers is an acknowledgement of the god 
 within each person 
 so on a deep level i absorbed the 
 profound respect for spirit and concern 
 for humanity that is woven into the 
 fabric of the quaker religion 
 which i feel had a strong influence on 
 me later in my life 
 when i was 14 years old i went through 
 an enormous emotional crisis 
 triggered initially by the collapse of 
 my first romance 
 with an older man of 19 i was sure no 
 one would ever compare 
 it snowballed into a deep and 
 long-lasting existential despair 
 i took a long hard look at life and 
 recognized that there was really no 
 point or meaning to it 
 i could see that all the things that 
 were supposed to provide significance in 
 life 
 education success relationships 
 money were in themselves ephemeral 
 meaningless 
 and empty there didn't seem to be 
 anything else to fill the void 
 i was deeply disillusioned and depressed 
 and basically remained in that state for 
 several years 
 in retrospect i can see that i was going 
 through an experience 
 that all of us must pass through at one 
 time or another or many times 
 what mystics call the piercing of the 
 veil of illusion 
 it's the point where we begin to 
 recognize that our physical world is not 
 the ultimate reality and we turn inward 
 to discover the spiritual aspect of our 
 existence 
 at these times we usually feel 
 emotionally 
 that we are hitting bottom but as we 
 actually hit bottom it's as if we fall 
 through a trap door into a new place 
 the inner realm of the soul where we can 
 begin to explore our connection to life 
 in a whole new way 
 when we can face our fears and move 
 through such a dark night of the soul 
 we are greeted by the dawn of a profound 
 new adventure 
 new experiences over the next few years 
 i began to have new experiences 
 openings a growing awareness that did 
 not fit into my former rational 
 framework 
 in college i studied psychology and got 
 involved in some encounter groups and 
 sensitivity training groups that 
 in addition to allowing me to release 
 old emotional pain 
 led me to new feelings of love joy and 
 oneness with all 
 i studied dance and discovered that when 
 i was dancing i would often have an 
 exhilarating feeling 
 as if some higher force had taken over 
 and was moving me in an abandoned and 
 thrilling way 
 i had always been interested in eastern 
 philosophy 
 so i read books about buddhism and 
 hinduism i practiced yoga and meditation 
 and found that they helped me feel more 
 centered 
 relaxed and in tune with myself after 
 graduating from college i spent two 
 years traveling around the world 
 living for several months in india where 
 i gained a deep awareness of the eastern 
 mystical tradition 
 my travels were a powerful experience 
 for me because with little money and no 
 real plans 
 i lived by following my intuition i had 
 set off originally for a vacation in 
 italy and ended up making a two-year 
 journey around the world 
 i learned that i could live happily with 
 virtually no possessions and move safely 
 into unknown places 
 this was one of my earliest experiences 
 of the synergistic things that happen 
 when we trust our inner guidance and 
 follow the flow of our energy 
 getting conscious when i return to the 
 united states i was hooked on something 
 called consciousness 
 i couldn't have defined what it was but 
 i knew that i wanted more of it and that 
 for me 
 nothing else mattered as much as my 
 process of personal growth 
 i felt that if i pursued external goals 
 such as career 
 money or relationships they would 
 ultimately feel empty 
 whereas if i devoted myself to my own 
 development i would ultimately have the 
 things that my heart desired such as 
 loving relationships 
 meaningful work and a sense of abundance 
 and that it would all come about in a 
 more satisfying way 
 i was motivated not only by my yearning 
 to find greater fulfillment in my own 
 life 
 but by a strong desire to make a 
 contribution toward positive change in 
 the world and in other people's healing 
 and happiness 
 i moved to the san francisco bay area 
 which i recognized as the forefront of 
 the so-called human potential movement 
 and plunged into the earnest pursuit of 
 knowledge wisdom 
 healing and transformation i took 
 classes and workshops 
 avidly read new books meditated and 
 talked constantly to others 
 involved in the same process after 
 reading handbook to higher consciousness 
 by ken keys 
 i went to live at his center in barclay 
 where we worked on our growth intensely 
 day and night for a year after that i 
 continued to live communally for several 
 of years with others who were involved 
 in an intensive personal development 
 process 
 during this time i did whatever i could 
 to make enough money to live on 
 housework office work odds and ends 
 while i focused on my real work 
 since that time over 25 years ago 
 my life has been dedicated to my growth 
 and evolution as a conscious being 
 i gradually came to understand that 
 becoming more conscious meant becoming 
 more aware of all that was taking place 
 within me and around me 
 how my inner world affected my outer 
 world and vice versa 
 i realized that the more awareness i 
 have the more choice i have in how i 
 create or respond to the circumstances 
 of my life 
 when we are relatively unconscious we 
 simply do what we've 
 always done not realizing there is any 
 other way 
 as we gradually become more aware we 
 begin to recognize that other options 
 exist and we can make other choices in 
 how we live 
 at first i imagine that this process 
 involved a straight line from a to b 
 a being the darkness of ignorance and b 
 being full enlightenment 
 the goal was to move from a to b as 
 directly as possible 
 if we were dedicated and fortunate 
 enough to achieve enlightenment 
 we would have completed the process we 
 would be radiant beings 
 always filled with light love and wisdom 
 eventually i understood that 
 consciousness is an ever unfolding 
 deepening and expanding process with no 
 endpoint 
 we are infinite and complex beings and 
 our human journey involves not just a 
 spiritual awakening 
 but the development of all levels of our 
 being spiritual 
 mental emotional and physical and the 
 integration of all these aspects into a 
 healthy and balanced daily life 
 i'm getting ahead of myself however so 
 back to my story 
 my name people often ask me about my 
 name so i thought i'd pause here and 
 tell you about it 
 while in india i became very fascinated 
 with a hindu rally giant and began to 
 study it 
 i had not been raised as a christian and 
 that religion had never held much 
 interest for me 
 i liked some of the ideas in buddhism a 
 lot but it seemed a bit intellectual to 
 me 
 the myths symbols and deities in the 
 hindu religion touched 
 me in a deeper place in my soul it is a 
 very complex religion and i don't even 
 pretend to understand it 
 but i grasped a few things in the hindu 
 religion there is a trinity of three 
 main deities that symbolize three 
 aspects of life 
 brahma is the creator vishnu is the 
 preserver 
 and shiva is the destroyer shiva 
 represents the constant changing of the 
 universe 
 the fact that everything must constantly 
 be destroyed in order to be reborn 
 he reminds us that we must constantly 
 let go of everything we hold on to 
 in order to flow with the motion of life 
 many of his fervent devotees give up 
 home and possessions and wander freely 
 abandoning themselves to following and 
 trusting the energy of the universe 
 shiva is also known as nataraj the lord 
 of the dance 
 literally the lord of rhythm they say 
 that it is his dance that keeps the 
 universe in motion 
 he is depicted as a very beautiful and 
 powerful man with long flowing hair 
 it is said that out of his hair flows 
 the holy ganges river 
 i felt irresistibly drawn to him shakti 
 is the feminine aspect of shiva 
 the word shakti means energy the energy 
 that everything in the universe 
 is made of it is the energy of life the 
 life force running through our bodies 
 it also means female energy in the hindu 
 practice of tantra 
 there are techniques for enlightenment 
 through channeling one's sexual energy 
 in this practice the man is referred to 
 ashiva and the woman a shakti 
 when i returned from india i met and for 
 several of years lived with 
 my friend mark allen he didn't think my 
 previous name fit me and 
 knowing of my love affair with shiva he 
 began calling me shakti 
 i liked it and began using it at the 
 time 
 i don't think i realized how powerful 
 the name was 
 but i certainly realize it now i feel 
 that the vibration of the name has 
 helped me to emerge into my power 
 gowan is the last name i was born with 
 it is the same name as sir gawain in the 
 king arthur legends 
 according to one dictionary definition 
 it means battle hawk 
 which i think is a wonderful image to me 
 shakti represents my feminine aspect and 
 garwin 
 my masculine aspect creative 
 visualization one of the earliest 
 workshops i took was the silva mind 
 control course 
 at that time i was still rather 
 skeptical about this sort of thing and 
 probably would never have gone to it 
 except that my mother had taken the 
 course and highly recommended it to me 
 i will never forget her description of a 
 technique in which you can imagine what 
 you want to have happen 
 and it will very often come about my 
 mind felt doubtful about this but my 
 heart made a leap and i remember 
 thinking 
 ever since i was a child i always knew 
 that there was magic 
 that somehow somewhere magic really 
 exists 
 this sounds like the closest thing to it 
 that i have ever heard of 
 i took the course and i was amazed we 
 started slowly and easily with simple 
 techniques that anyone could accept and 
 do 
 and gradually we worked our way into 
 more unexplainable but very powerful 
 processes after five days i had a strong 
 psychic experience in which 
 for a period of several hours i was able 
 to consistently pick 
 up specific information that i had no 
 way of knowing except through my 
 intuition 
 that experience began to dissolve some 
 of my former limits on what i thought 
 was possible 
 the most important technique i learned 
 in that course was the basic technique 
 of creative visualization 
 relaxing deeply and then picturing a 
 desired goal in your mind exactly the 
 way you want it to be 
 i started to practice this technique and 
 found that it was amazingly effective 
 quite often the things i pictured came 
 true quickly and in unexpected ways i 
 became fascinated with the possibilities 
 and took some other classes and 
 workshops on similar subjects 
 i began to use creative visualization 
 techniques in my life regularly and to 
 teach them to my friends 
 i read the nature of personal reality by 
 jane roberts and was powerfully affected 
 by the idea that we all create our own 
 reality 
 soon i began to lead workshops and do 
 private counseling 
 and eventually wrote creative 
 visualization when i got the idea to 
 write the book 
 i just wanted to gather all the ideas 
 and techniques i had learned from 
 various sources and put them down on 
 paper in a comprehensive way 
 i thought i would write a little booklet 
 i could give to friends and perhaps sell 
 to my clients and a few 
 interested people as i wrote it i was 
 filled with self-doubt 
 who am i to be writing a book like this 
 i'm no expert 
 some force inside of me kept pushing me 
 to do it however 
 so i did i used creative visualization 
 techniques to help create the book 
 i got an artist friend to design the 
 cover then 
 i hung the cover up on my wall and kept 
 imagining and affirming that the book 
 was already finished 
 i found writing it was fairly effortless 
 except for my nagging doubts 
 and before i knew it it had turned into 
 a real book that some friends and i 
 published together 
 what i didn't fully realize at the time 
 was that the book was coming from a 
 higher creative source within me 
 on a personality level i had doubts and 
 fears 
 but because of my inner commitment to 
 myself i was willing to go ahead and 
 follow the creative energy anyhow 
 because i had a natural ability to think 
 and write clearly 
 was really interested in these ideas had 
 a good background in the subject 
 and was willing to take some risks the 
 universe could use me 
 as a creative channel the publishing 
 process was similar 
 my friends mark allen and john bernoff 
 and i knew very little about business or 
 publishing 
 and had no money at all but we had a 
 desire to write and publish our own 
 books 
 by trusting our feelings and being 
 willing to risk acting on them 
 we found that we were led step by step 
 in what we needed to do 
 we made many mistakes in the process 
 mostly when we didn't follow our inner 
 guidance 
 and some of them were painful and 
 extremely expensive 
 but eventually we created a successful 
 publishing company 
 originally named whatever publishing 
 incorporated 
 now called new world library creative 
 visualization has been successful far 
 beyond any wild fantasy i might have had 
 at the time i wrote it 
 although it was never marketed or 
 publicized in any significant way 
 other than through word of mouth at the 
 time of this writing it has sold nearly 
 3 million copies and has been translated 
 into over 25 foreign languages 
 20 years after its original publication 
 in 1978 
 the revised edition is still selling 
 steadily through the years 
 i have received countless letters and 
 calls from people all over 
 the world saying it has helped them 
 transform their lives 
 of course this has been quite gratifying 
 to me especially because i can see that 
 it is the higher power of the universe 
 at work 
 i have felt like a proud mother watching 
 my child out there in the world 
 doing its work and making its fortune 
 knowing that it is mine and yet not mine 
 it came through me and i helped to form 
 it and yet it is a being 
 an entity of its own with its own 
 destiny and its own connection to the 
 creative source 
 listening to inner guidance when i first 
 discovered the techniques of creative 
 visualization and found that they worked 
 i was excited because i felt that 
 through using them i could create 
 whatever i wanted in my life 
 i was elated by the feeling that i could 
 have everything i desired 
 this was an important step for me as it 
 took me out of the essentially powerless 
 attitude that i had had previously 
 the attitude that life is something that 
 happens to you and that all you can do 
 is make the best of it 
 it was in some ways a victim position 
 giving power to people 
 and things outside of myself using 
 creative visualization 
 i began to realize that the power rested 
 in me that i could choose to create my 
 life the way i wanted it to be 
 it was very empowering and very freeing 
 as i explored the process of creating my 
 own reality 
 i gradually began to realize that the 
 creative power i was feeling was coming 
 from a source other than just my 
 personality 
 for one thing some of the things i 
 thought i wanted didn't manifest 
 and in retrospect i could see that it 
 was for my highest good that they didn't 
 happen 
 other things occurred so miraculously 
 that it was as if some unseen force was 
 putting everything in place 
 sometimes i would have flashes of 
 insight and awareness or 
 future visions that were highly accurate 
 and seem to come from a source deep 
 within myself 
 i became more and more interested in 
 discovering what this creative force was 
 all about and how it worked 
 i began to realize that it my soul or 
 higher self 
 seem to know more than i my personality 
 self 
 did about a lot of things i saw that it 
 would probably be smart to try to find 
 out what that inner gear dance was 
 telling me 
 and follow it every time i did that it 
 seemed to work eventually 
 i lost interest in trying to control my 
 life to make things happen in a way that 
 i thought i wanted them to happen 
 i began to practice surrendering to the 
 higher power of the universe within me 
 and finding out what it wanted me to do 
 i discovered that in the long run it 
 really wasn't that different 
 the universe always seems to want me to 
 have everything i truly want 
 and it seems to know how to guide me in 
 creating it more effectively than i 
 would know how to create it myself 
 the emphasis is different though instead 
 of figuring out what i wanted 
 setting goals and trying to control what 
 happened to me 
 i began to practice tuning in 
 receptively to my intuition and acting 
 on what it told me without always 
 understanding why i was doing what i was 
 doing it was a feeling of letting go of 
 control 
 surrendering and allowing the higher 
 power to be in charge 
 about this time i met a woman named 
 shirley luthman who 
 became a very important teacher to me 
 she led a group each week and i began to 
 go to it faithfully and continue to do 
 so for five years 
 she taught me a great deal about how to 
 trust and follow my own intuitive sense 
 many of the ideas in living in the light 
 including the concept of male and female 
 in the way i use it 
 were inspired by shirley and i am deeply 
 grateful for what she taught me 
 trusting myself after several of years 
 with shirley 
 i had to confront the fact that there 
 were things that were happening in the 
 group that didn't feel right to me 
 and that i couldn't find a way to give 
 my input that was received 
 i found myself confronting the age-old 
 problem of how to let go of the guru 
 i respected shirley so much and what i 
 had received from her had been so 
 valuable 
 that it was very difficult to face the 
 time when i knew that i could not look 
 to her for answers anymore 
 in a sense shirley was the metaphysical 
 mother who had given me the support and 
 security i needed until i was 
 ready to trust myself eventually my 
 inner guidance told me i had to stop 
 relying on her 
 the time had come for me to trust the 
 power of my own inner guidance 
 it was both terrifying and liberating to 
 realize that i had my 
 own path and there was no one ahead of 
 me who had all the answers 
 once creative visualization became 
 popular many people began 
 asking me to write another book about 
 two years after creative visualization 
 was published 
 i began to have strong feelings that i 
 would do so 
 one day as i was walking in the woods i 
 was thinking about my new book and i 
 wondered idly what i should call it 
 suddenly my attention was drawn to a 
 patch of woods near the path where a ray 
 of sunlight was filtering brightly 
 through the trees and shining on the 
 green leaves 
 it was a beautiful sight and as i gazed 
 the words living in the light came to me 
 i knew immediately that it was the title 
 of my next book and i remember the 
 feeling that i hadn't really 
 thought of it myself but that i had 
 received it i even had the impression 
 that i didn't have much choice about it 
 that i was being directed to use that 
 name i felt very inspired 
 began to make some notes and told people 
 that i was working on my new book 
 my publishing company had a cover 
 designed and began to do some 
 preliminary promotion 
 but after a while i noticed that i 
 hadn't actually written anything 
 i kept thinking it was going to happen 
 but it didn't 
 the truth was i was not feeling the 
 energy to actually sit down and write 
 and no amount of thinking that i should 
 do it was making it happen 
 by this time in my life i was quite 
 committed to the philosophy that life 
 doesn't have to be a struggle 
 i felt that when it was ready to happen 
 it would happen naturally 
 i wasn't willing to do it if it felt 
 like too much of a push 
 i sensed that the moment would come when 
 the energy would be so strong that i 
 wouldn't be able not to write 
 several of years went by and i became 
 involved in many other things 
 people continued to ask for my new book 
 and i kept reassuring them that it would 
 be along eventually 
 privately i sometimes had my doubts 
 and i had to accept the fact that it was 
 possible that it wouldn't happen 
 still i felt that it would writing this 
 book was a little like being pregnant 
 i could feel something forming and 
 growing inside of me and i knew that i 
 was creating 
 even though nothing seemed to be 
 happening externally the baby would 
 emerge when it was fully formed and 
 ready 
 finally seven years after the 
 publication of creative visualization 
 the time had come to write living in the 
 light at this point 
 in my life i was extremely busy and had 
 little time to devote to writing 
 still this book would not be stopped 
 laurel king 
 a friend who had been working for me for 
 a few years helped me get my notes and 
 ideas gathered together 
 and down on paper and contributed her 
 own creative ideas and exercises 
 i found a few days or a few hours here 
 and there to write 
 i was spending a lot of time flying all 
 over the world to lead workshops 
 so much of living in the light was 
 written on airplanes 
 as in writing my first book i had to 
 deal with fears and doubts that 
 occasionally besieged me 
 this time instead of war ryan whether i 
 had the right or credibility to share my 
 knowledge 
 i had the opposite problem with creative 
 visualization proving to be wildly 
 successful 
 i wondered whether my second book would 
 live up to that standard 
 or would perhaps be a total flop i now 
 understood one aspect of the 
 difficulties that can accompany fame 
 and the pressure that all successful 
 creative people face to keep producing 
 successful work 
 in spite of the obstacles the book 
 seemed to flow from that deep creative 
 source within me 
 it was published in 1986 by our 
 company new world library by this time 
 we knew a lot more about publishing 
 still we didn't do a great deal of 
 publicity or marketing 
 this book however seemed to have a life 
 and a day tiny of its own 
 like creative visualization it's sold 
 mainly through word of mouth 
 along with creative visualization it has 
 become known as a classic in the field 
 of personal growth 
 naturally i am very pleased by the fact 
 that living in the light has reached so 
 many people and encouraged them in their 
 personnel growth process 
 some of my most precious moments have 
 been when someone approaches me at a 
 workshop and tells me 
 with tears in their eyes that this book 
 has been like a good friend to them 
 helping them through a particularly dark 
 or challenging time in their life 
 i feel so grateful that the universe has 
 guided me on a path whereby sharing my 
 own learning process 
 i have been able to make a contribution 
 to other people's lives 
 my journey continues meanwhile the 
 success of my second book had made me 
 busier than ever 
 i was spending most of my time leading 
 workshops 
 i had found that passing along to others 
 what i was learning was a very important 
 and challenging part of my 
 own growth process my workshops continue 
 to evolve and change as i did 
 since i was always teaching what i was 
 learning i love working with people on 
 deep levels of change 
 growth and transformation and i devoted 
 myself to my work 
 eventually i found that i had become a 
 workaholic 
 and my work was consuming my life 
 much as i loved my career i began to 
 feel an increasing sense of imbalance in 
 my life 
 i was great at giving to the world but 
 had a hard time creating enough space 
 for receiving 
 so i began to burn out i longed for more 
 quiet time 
 time for myself and my own personal 
 needs yet 
 i had a hard time saying no to all the 
 exciting work opportunities that came my 
 way 
 for quite some time i had been longing 
 to find the right man to be my partner 
 in life 
 i had been visualizing him ever since i 
 learned that technique 
 but somehow he hadn't shown up i was 
 almost always in a relationship 
 they were all deep learning healing 
 experiences for me 
 and all were wonderful in certain ways 
 for one reason or another 
 however they weren't quite right for a 
 long-term commitment 
 i couldn't understand why i felt so 
 ready for a committed relationship and 
 yet it wasn't happening for me 
 it took me a long time to realize that i 
 wasn't really ready at all 
 in fact i had deep conflict and 
 ambivalence about commitment 
 and a lot of emotional healing to do in 
 the area of relationships 
 going back to my parents divorce and 
 even before that 
 to old family patterns i went through a 
 period where i devoted myself to my 
 emotional healing process 
 including deep work in therapy at this 
 time 
 some wonderful teachers came into my 
 life a couple named dr 
 hal and dr sitter stone they had both 
 been therapists for many years and had 
 developed a body of work called the 
 psychology of selves 
 and a very powerful technique called 
 voice dialogue 
 from the stone's teachings i began to 
 understand more clearly that we all have 
 many different energies 
 or selves within us voice dialogue 
 provides an amazing way 
 to get directly in touch with these 
 different selves become more conscious 
 of them 
 and bring them into greater balance 
 through this work 
 i discovered many fascinating things 
 about myself and became much more aware 
 of what was going on inside of 
 me this brought me tremendous healing 
 and growth 
 the stones have a very developed 
 understanding of the dynamics of human 
 relationship and how our relationships 
 mirror consciousness 
 using their work enabled me to resolve 
 many aspects of my own relationship 
 issues 
 hal and siddha stone have become good 
 friends and i consider them my mentors 
 i highly recommend their books tapes and 
 workshops 
 which are listed in the recommended 
 resources section of this book 
 and i have integrated their work into my 
 own writing and workshops 
 after doing a great deal of deep work i 
 began to feel a major shift taking place 
 within me 
 i was more aware than ever of the 
 different parts of myself and i felt 
 increasingly comfortable with all of 
 them i was aware of my power and 
 independence 
 but also of my vulnerability and need i 
 felt more able to love all aspects of 
 who i 
 am and more able to be with myself in a 
 whole new way 
 at this point i had a knowing this that 
 i was ready for a committed partnership 
 i was still unable to use the m word 
 mariaj 
 however this felt very different than 
 the experience i had had for so long of 
 thinking i was ready 
 now i sense that my partner would be 
 coming along soon 
 less than a month later i connected with 
 jim burns 
 a bright handsome and loving man whom i 
 had met a couple of years before but 
 hadn't seen in the interim 
 actually i had met him because of this 
 book 
 he had read living in the light while 
 living in minnesota 
 and came out to california to one of my 
 workshops 
 to make a long and romantic story short 
 we fell in love and were married within 
 a year 
 being in a committed relationship has 
 been a powerful experience of growth for 
 me 
 i truly understand now that deep 
 relationship is the clearest mirror we 
 have 
 and therefore the greatest path to 
 consciousness 
 this however is a topic for another book 
 i now divide my time between our home 
 and office in california ornia 
 our beautiful home on the island of 
 calais and traveling to lead workshops 
 around the world 
 i am most excited about the in-depth 
 work that takes place in the intensive 
 programs i conduct in hawaii and 
 california 
 and my two-year mentoring program the 
 primary focus of my work now is on 
 becoming conscious of the many different 
 aspects of who we are 
 and learning to develop and express the 
 infinite energies within us 
 this involves a great deal of what is 
 often called shadow work 
 becoming aware of the parts of ourselves 
 that we have denied are repressed 
 because we feel they are unacceptable 
 and learning to value them and make them 
 part of our lives 
 this healing work brings us into a 
 greater and greater sense of balance and 
 wholeness 
 i understand better than ever now that 
 living in the light involves traveling 
 into the darker places within ourselves 
 and shining the light of our 
 consciousness into them so that we can 
 truly love and express all that we are 
 on this amazing human journey of ours 
 the strongest guiding force we have is 
 right within us 
 we gain access to it through our 
 intuitive sense 
 our gut feelings about what is right and 
 true for us 
 the development of our relationship with 
 our inner guidance is what this book is 
 all about 
 may it serve you well with love shakti

 part 1 the principles chapter 1 a new 
 way of life we are living in a very 
 exciting and powerful time 
 on the deepest level of consciousness a 
 radical transformation is taking place 
 as the evolution of human consciousness 
 gains greater and greater momentum 
 we are being challenged on a planetary 
 level to let go of our present way of 
 life and create a new one 
 in a sense our old world is dying and a 
 new world is coming into being 
 for many of us the old world was based 
 on an external focus 
 having lost our fundamental spiritual 
 connection we have believed that the 
 material world is the only reality 
 thus feeling essentially lost empty and 
 alone 
 we have continually attempted to 27. 
 find happiness and fulfillment through 
 external things 
 money material possessions relationships 
 work fame food drugs and so on 
 the new world is being built as we open 
 to the higher power of the universe 
 within us and consciously allow that 
 creative energy to move through us 
 as each of us connects with our inner 
 spiritual awareness 
 we learn that the creative power of the 
 universe is inside of us 
 we also learned that we can create our 
 own experience of reality 
 and take responsibility for doing so the 
 change begins within each individual 
 but as more and more individuals are 
 transformed the mass consciousness is 
 increasingly affected 
 my observation that a profound 
 transformation of consciousness is 
 taking place in our world at this time 
 is based on the changes i see within 
 myself those around me 
 and in our society it is affirmed by 
 feedback i receive from thousands of 
 people i work with all over the world 
 living in the light is about this 
 transformation of consciousness 
 within each individual and in the world 
 my use of the terms old world and new 
 world throughout the book refer to the 
 old way of living that we are 
 relinquishing 
 and the new one that we are creating for 
 many people 
 this time may be distressing because the 
 world situation and or our personal 
 lives may seem to be going from bad to 
 worse 
 it's as if many things are falling apart 
 and will continue to do so with even 
 greater intensity 
 but on the deepest level i do not feel 
 this is negative 
 it is upsetting to us to the degree that 
 we are emotionally attached to our old 
 way of living 
 instead fastly follow old patterns 
 rather than trying to open our eyes to 
 the profound changes that are occurring 
 paradoxical as it may seem these changes 
 are the greatest blessing that any of us 
 could possibly imagine 
 the truth is that the way of life that 
 we have been following for centuries no 
 longer works 
 while appropriate for its time it cannot 
 take us where we need and desire to go 
 the focus on materialism and the 
 external world was necessary in a time 
 when our primary challenge was physical 
 survival 
 our patriarchal values and the 
 traditional roles of men and women may 
 have been necessary in order to ensure 
 the protection of our families for a 
 certain period of time in our 
 evolutionary process 
 at this time many human beings and other 
 species as well 
 on the earth are still struggling for 
 physical survival 
 yet there are an increasing number of us 
 who no longer have to be preoccupied 
 primarily with sheer survival 
 we have the opportunity and thus the 
 responsibility 
 to begin looking for deeper fulfillment 
 on spiritual 
 mental and emotional levels we are 
 searching for greater meaning and 
 purpose in our lives 
 and for ways to live more responsibly 
 and harmoniously on our planet 
 while some people throughout history 
 have led relatively meaningful 
 and satisfying lives i'm afraid that 
 most of us have never found the 
 fulfillment that we have yearned for 
 our cultural conditioning has not given 
 us the tools to develop a healthy 
 connection with our inner realms of soul 
 intuition and feeling and to integrate 
 them with our external world 
 in a way it's as if we've been in school 
 for our entire lives 
 receiving an education that teaches the 
 exact opposite of the way the universe 
 actually functions 
 we try to make things work as we've been 
 taught and we may even enjoy some degree 
 of success 
 but for most of us things never seem to 
 work out as well as we had hoped 
 that perfect relationship never 
 materializes or if it does 
 it soon sours or fades away or it may 
 seem as though there is never quite 
 enough money 
 we never feel truly secure or abundant 
 perhaps we don't get the appreciation 
 recognition or success that we want even 
 if we do achieve some of these things 
 we still may suffer from a vague sense 
 that there must be something more 
 some deeper meaning some of us may 
 actually connect with that deeper 
 meaning and feel increasingly fulfilled 
 and expanded by a growing spiritual 
 awareness 
 nevertheless there are stubborn and 
 sometimes puzzling old patterns and 
 areas of life where we experience great 
 pain and confusion 
 thus our first task in building the new 
 world is to admit that our life 
 education has not necessarily taught us 
 a satisfying way to live 
 we must learn a way of life that is very 
 different from the way we approach 
 things before 
 this may not be easy for us and it will 
 take time 
 commitment and courage therefore it's 
 very important to be compassionate with 
 ourselves 
 to continually remind ourselves what a 
 tremendous task we are undertaking 
 it will not be accomplished overnight in 
 fact it is a lifelong process 
 just as a baby learns to walk by falling 
 down repeatedly 
 we must remember that we are babies in 
 the new world 
 we will learn by making lots of mistakes 
 and often we may feel ignorant 
 frightened or unsure of ourselves but we 
 would not get angry at a baby every 
 time he fell down if we did he'd 
 probably never learn to walk with full 
 confidence and power 
 so we must try not to criticize 
 ourselves if we are not able to live and 
 express 
 ourselves as fully as we wish 
 immediately we are now learning to live 
 more fully in accordance with the laws 
 of the universe 
 we are challenged to explore all aspects 
 of our human experience and to develop 
 all levels of our being 
 the spiritual mental and emotional as 
 well as the physical 
 as we do this work we experience an 
 increasing sense 
 of wholeness empowerment aliveness and a 
 feeling of being on purpose in our lives 
 so although letting go the old world may 
 seem difficult at times 
 it is well worth the commitment and hard 
 work it takes to gradually make this 
 transition into the new world meditation 
 sit or lie down 
 relax close your eyes and take a few 
 deep breaths 
 as you exhale imagine that you are 
 letting go of everything that you don't 
 want or need 
 easily without effort let any 
 frustrations 
 tiredness or worries melt away this is a 
 time to release an old way of life that 
 no longer works for you 
 imagine that your old ways your old 
 patterns and all the obstacles to 
 achieving what you truly want are gently 
 dissolved and leaving your body with 
 each breath 
 every time you exhale and release a 
 little of your old limitations 
 you create more space inside of you for 
 something new 
 after doing this for a few minutes begin 
 to imagine that every 
 time you inhale you are breathing in 
 life energy the life force of the 
 universe 
 within this life energy is everything 
 you need and desire 
 love power health beauty strength 
 abundance breathe it in with each 
 inhalation 
 imagine a new way of life opening up 
 filling you with aliveness 
 vitality and energy pretend your life is 
 exactly the way you want it to be 
 imagine this new life is here now and 
 savor it 
 when the meditation feels complete 
 gently open your eyes and come back into 
 the room 
 see if you can retain that sense of 
 newness in yourself 
 remember that you are now in the process 
 of creating a new life for yourself 
 chapter 2 the higher power within us 
 t he foundation for life in the new 
 world is built on the under 
 standing that there is a higher 
 intelligence a fundamental creative 
 power or energy in the universe that is 
 the source and substance of 
 all existence the words and concepts 
 that have been used to 
 describe this power are innumerable here 
 are just a few god spirit inner guidance 
 goddess essence higher self higher power 
 being the universe 
 source soul life force 33. 
 the tau the force cosmic intelligence 
 buddha nature the light christ 
 consciousness 
 great spirit i am all that is these 
 terms are attempts to express 
 and experience or know inkness that is 
 difficult to convey in words and 
 rational concepts 
 each of us has this experience within us 
 the words we choose to 
 describe it are merely the labels that 
 suit us best 
 i seldom use the word god as it has so 
 many confusing con 
 notations for so many frequently people 
 associate it with early 
 religious training which is no longer 
 meaningful to them 
 some may think of god as someone or 
 something outside of themselves 
 the old man in the sky with the long 
 white beard 
 i prefer term such as higher power 
 the universe spirit or inner guidance 
 in this book i will use some of these 
 terms interchangeably to refer to our 
 spiritual source the essential creative 
 intelligence and power with 
 in us if any of these terms are not 
 particularly meaningful to you 
 please feel free to substitute whatever 
 word you prefer 
 for the first 20 years of my life my 
 connection to the 
 spiritual aspect of my being was largely 
 undeveloped 
 i had no conscious experience of 
 or belief in a higher power of any sort 
 i have had to move through many levels 
 of doubt 
 skepticism diss belief and fear in order 
 to arrive at the great trust i now have 
 in 
 the higher power of the universe that is 
 within me and within 
 everyone and everything that exists i 
 have not accepted anything 
 on blind faith so in a sense i have had 
 to prove everything to 
 myself through my life experiences as 
 i've learned to place my 
 trust in the higher power of the 
 universe and to live in accordance 
 with universal principles the changes i 
 have felt and seen in my life 
 are truly miraculous those of you who 
 have felt deep spiritual awareness 
 through 
 out your lives already have a solid 
 foundation to build upon 
 4. those of you who have felt 
 spiritually disconnected as i have 
 i hope my words will support and 
 encourage you to find this inner 
 connection for yourself there is no 
 specific way to do this 
 every one's experience is different 
 if this is something that you desire ask 
 within yourself that you be guided into 
 an experience of your 
 own spiritual nature this may take some 
 time 
 but if you desire it it will happen 
 the words and exercises in this book may 
 help 
 you with this the universe has both 
 personal and impersonal aspects 
 as i surrender and trust more i find my 
 relationship with this higher 
 power becoming more personal i can 
 sometimes sense a presence 
 within me guiding me loving me teaching 
 me 
 encouraging me in this personal aspect 
 the universe can be teacher guide friend 
 mother father lover creative genius 
 or fairy godmother in other words 
 many of my needs and desires can be 
 fulfilled through this 
 inner connection i often find the most 
 powerful communion with 
 the universe when i'm alone especially 
 out in nature 
 at such times the places inside of me 
 that sometimes feel empty are filled 
 with the energy of spirit here i find a 
 guiding presence that 
 nudges me in the direction i need to go 
 and helps me to learn the 
 lesson that lies in taking each step 
 along my path 
 meditation sit or lie down in a 
 comfortable position 
 close your eyes and take a few deep 
 breaths 
 each time you exhale relax your body 
 more and more then take a few more deep 
 breaths and 
 each time you exhale relax your mind 
 let your thoughts drift by without 
 holding on to any of them 
 allow your mind to go out of focus relax 
 your awareness into a deep place within 
 you 
 imagine that there is a very powerful 
 presence within you 
 this presence is totally loving strong 
 and wise it is nurturing pro 
 protecting guiding and caring for you 
 at times it can be very strong and 
 forceful 
 it can also be very light joyful and 
 playful 
 as you get to know and trust it it will 
 make your life exciting 
 meaning full and fulfilling 
 you may get an image or feeling or 
 physical sensation that 
 represents this higher presence even if 
 you don't see or feel a 
 thing assume it is there regardless 
 relax and enjoy the feeling or thought 
 that you are being total 
 lie taken care of by the universe say 
 this affirmation to yourself 
 silently or allowed i feel and trust the 
 presence of the universe in my 
 life chapter 3 intuition 
 once we acknowledge the higher power of 
 the universe 
 the obvious question arises how can we 
 contact this power and gain 
 access to it after all if there is 
 within us a superior wisdom or a 
 deeper knowledge than we normally 
 experience by tapping into it 
 we should be able to receive valuable 
 guidance and how to live well 
 in this confusing world this realization 
 began to dawn on me many 
 years ago as i undertook my journey of 
 consciousness 
 i have since discover that the 
 knowingness that resides in each of us 
 can be 
 access through what we usually call our 
 intuition 
 by learning to contact listen to 
 and act on our intuition we can directly 
 connect 
 to this inner wisdom and allow it to 
 become our guiding force 
 37 this is where we find ourselves in 
 opposition to life as most of 
 us have been taught to live it in the 
 old world in modern western 
 civilization we have learned to respect 
 and even worship the ratio 
 now logical aspect of our being and to 
 dismiss 
 depreciate or deny our intuition 
 we do acknowledge the ability of animals 
 to seem 
 english understand things that are way 
 beyond their rational capacity 
 we call this instinct but it's a mystery 
 that defies logical explanation 
 so we shrug our shoulders and dismiss it 
 as something vastly inf 
 raw or to the magnificent human ability 
 to reason 
 our culture's entire value system is 
 firmly based on the belief 
 that the rational principle is superior 
 and in fact 
 constitutes the highest truth 
 the western scientific tradition has 
 become a rally 
 gian we are taught from a young age to 
 try to be reasonable 
 log ical and consistent to avoid 
 emotional 
 irrational behavior and to suppress our 
 feelings 
 at best feelings and emotions are 
 considered 
 foolish weak and bothersome at worst 
 we fear they may threat in the very 
 fabric of civilized society 
 our established religious institutions 
 often support this fear of 
 the intuitive non-racial self once based 
 on a deep awareness of 
 the universal spiritual principle in 
 every being 
 many religions only pay lip service to 
 that idea now 
 instead they seek to control the 
 behavior of their devotees 
 using elaborate rule structures per 
 ported to save people from their deep 
 irrational 
 and basically sinful natures and 
 according to many psychological 
 disciplines 
 the dark and dangerous instinctual 
 nature of man must be con 
 trolled from this perspective it is only 
 the rational part of us that 
 is capable of harnessing this mysterious 
 force and channeling it 
 into healthy constructive modes in our 
 worship of the rational and fear of the 
 non-racial 
 we deny not only our emotions and our 
 instinctual energies such as 
 sexuality and aggression but also our 
 natural intuitive sense 
 which is meant to be a primary guiding 
 force in our lives 
 generally less technically developed 
 societies approach life 
 with a deep awareness of and respect for 
 the intuitive element of 
 existence every moment of their daily 
 lives is guided by a strong 
 sense of connection with the creative 
 force however 
 it is there very lack of technical 
 development that has contributed to 
 their 
 gradual destruction or subversion by 
 modern civilization 
 two examples relevant to most americans 
 are the native american 
 and african cultures both of these 
 groups were devastated by their contact 
 with european 
 american culture however a deep curios 
 curiosity 
 respect and appreciation for native 
 americans has begun to 
 surface in our awareness in recent years 
 in the african culture 
 forcibly brought to this continent has 
 probably done more than 
 any other culture to keep the intuitive 
 power alive in our country 
 through its strong and soulful 
 connection to spirit 
 in human evolution it seems that as our 
 rational capacity has 
 evolved we've grown increasingly fearful 
 of the other aspects of 
 our natures we've attempted to control 
 these dark forces by 
 aiding authoritative rule structures 
 that define right and wrong 
 good and bad and appropriate and 
 inappropriate behavior in a 
 very heavy-handed way we justify this 
 rigid approach to life by 
 blaming everything on non-racial nature 
 from our personnel 
 emotional dramas to social ills such as 
 drug and alcohol 
 addiction crime violence and war 
 the truth is that all aspects of our 
 being are integral emperor 
 stand and valuable parts of us the more 
 we distrust and suppress 
 these energies the more likely they are 
 to eventually burst out in 
 distorted ways in other words our 
 problems are not necessarily 
 caused by our emotional non-racial 
 nature running wild and 
 uncontrolled instead both personal and 
 social problems are more 
 likely to be the result of fear and the 
 suppression of our emotions 
 instinctual nature and intuition in this 
 book 
 we are focusing on how we can reclaim 
 the power of our intuitive sense 
 once we accept the reality of a higher 
 power that is channeled 
 to us through our intuition it becomes 
 clear that many of urpur 
 sonal problems and the ills of the world 
 are actually caused by not 
 following our intuition our rational 
 mind is like a computer 
 it processes the input it receives and 
 calculates logical conclusions based on 
 this infer 
 mattian the rational mind is finite it 
 can only compute the input 
 it has received directly in other words 
 our rational minds can only 
 operate on the basis of the direct 
 experience each of us has had in 
 this lifetime the intuitive mind on the 
 other hand 
 seems to have access to an infinite 
 supply of information 
 it appears to be able to tap into a deep 
 storehouse of knowledge and wisdom 
 the universal mind it is also able to 
 sort out this information and supply us 
 with exactly what we need when we need 
 it though the message 
 may come through a bit at a time if we 
 learn to follow this up 
 ply of information piece by piece the 
 necessary course of action 
 will be revealed as we learn to rely on 
 this guidance 
 life takes on a flowing effortless 
 quality 
 our life feelings and actions enter 
 weave harmoniously with those of others 
 around us 
 it is as if each of us played a unique 
 instrument in a huge sim 
 phony orchestra conducted by a universal 
 intelligence 
 if we play our part without regard for 
 the conductor's direction or the rest of 
 the orchestra we will have total chaos 
 if we try to take our cues 
 from those around us rather than the 
 conductor it will be imposed 
 cybel to achieve harmony there are too 
 many people 
 all playing different things our 
 intellect is not able to process so much 
 input 
 and decide on the best note to play at 
 each moment however 
 if we watch the conductor and follow his 
 direction we can experience 
 the joy of playing our unique part which 
 can be heard and upper 
 jaded by everyone and at the same time 
 experience 
 ourselves as part of a greater 
 harmonious whole 
 when we apply this analogy to our lives 
 we see that most of 
 us have never realized a conductor was 
 present 
 we have lived the best we can using only 
 our intellect to understand our lives 
 to fig you route the best course of 
 action 
 if we are honest with ourselves we will 
 readily admit that we are not making 
 great music 
 under the guidance of our rational mind 
 alone 
 the dissonance and chaos in our lives 
 and in the world certainly reflects the 
 impossibility of live 
 in this way by tuning into the intuition 
 and allowing it to become the good 
 ink force in our lives we allow our 
 inner conductor to take its 
 rightful place as the leader of the 
 orchestra rather than losing our 
 individual freedom we receive the 
 support we need to effectively 
 express our individuality moreover we 
 will enjoy the experience of 
 being part of a larger creative process 
 i don't fully understand how the 
 intuition functions in such an 
 amazing way but i definitely know 
 through direct experience 
 and through observation and feedback 
 from the many people i have 
 worked with that it does and i find that 
 the more i trust and fall 
 low this inner intuitive voice the 
 easier fuller 
 and more exciting my life becomes 
 meditation sit or lie down in a 
 comfortable position in a quiet place 
 close your eyes and relax 
 take several slow deep breaths relaxing 
 your 
 body more with each breath relax your 
 mind and let your 
 thoughts drift but don't hold on to any 
 thought 
 imagine that your mind becomes as quiet 
 as a peaceful lake 
 now focus your conscious awareness into 
 a deep place in your 
 body in the area of your stomach or 
 solar plexus 
 it should be the place in your body 
 where you feel that your gut feelings 
 reside 
 this is the physical place where you can 
 easily contact you're into 
 i shin imagine that you have a wise 
 being living inside there 
 you might have an image of what this 
 wise being looks like 
 or you might just sense that it is there 
 this wise being is really a part of you 
 your intuitive self you can communicate 
 with it by silently 
 talking to it making requests or asking 
 questions 
 then relax don't think too hard with 
 your rational mind 
 and be open to receiving the answers 
 the answers are usually very simple they 
 relate to the present moment not the 
 past or future 
 and they feel right if you don't receive 
 an immediate answer 
 let go and go about your life 
 the answer will come later whether from 
 inside of you 
 in the form of a feeling or idea or from 
 outside through a 
 person a book an event or whatever 
 for example you might say intuition tell 
 me what i need to 
 no here what do i need to do in this 
 situation 
 trust the feeling that you get an act on 
 it if it is truly your 
 intuition you will find that it leads to 
 a feeling of greater aliveness 
 and power and more opportunities begin 
 to open up for you 
 if it doesn't lead to these things you 
 may not have been truly acting 
 from your intuition but from some other 
 voice in you 
 go back and ask for clarification 
 it takes practice to hear and trust your 
 intuition 
 the more you do it the easier it will 
 become 
 eventually you will be able to con tact 
 your intuition 
 ask yourself questions and know that in 
 that 
 wise being within you an incredible 
 source of power and strength 
 is available to answer your questions 
 and guide you 
 as you grow more sensitive to this 
 guidance you will gain a sense of 
 knowing 
 what you need to do in any situation 
 your intuitive power is 
 always available to guide you whenever 
 you need it it will open to 
 you as you become willing to trust 
 yourself and your internal 
 edge chapter 4 becoming a creative 
 channel 
 t.o whatever degree you listen to and 
 follow your intuition 
 you become a creative channel for the 
 higher power of the universe 
 when you willingly follow where your 
 creative energy leads 
 the higher power can come through you to 
 manifest its creative work 
 when this happens you will find yourself 
 flowing with the inner 
 gee doing what you really want to do and 
 feeling the power of the 
 universe moving through you to create or 
 transform everything 
 around you in using the word channel i 
 am not referring to the psychic 
 process of trans channeling trans 
 channeling involves a muddy 
 um who goes into a trance state and 
 allows another being to speak 
 44. through him or her by channeling 
 i mean being in touch with and bringing 
 through the wisdom and creativity of 
 your own deepest 
 source being a channel is being fully 
 and freely yourself and khan 
 cisly knowing that you are a vehicle for 
 the creativity of the uni 
 verse every creative genius has been a 
 channel 
 every masterwork has been created 
 through the channeling process 
 great works are not created by the 
 personality alone 
 they arise from a deep inspira shin on 
 the universal level 
 and are then expressed and brought into 
 form through the individual personality 
 a person may have great technical skill 
 but without the ability 
 tie to connect with a deeper source his 
 work will be uninspiring 
 the difference between a technician and 
 a channel was clearly 
 demonstrated in the movie amadeus the 
 composer say larry knew 
 how to write music but he didn't know 
 how to tap into the creative 
 source mozart wrote music that was both 
 technically perfect and 
 wonderfully inspired and he did so 
 easily 
 spontaneously without thought or 
 effort from his early childhood on music 
 just seemed 
 to bubble up and overflow from within 
 him i'm sure he had no 
 idea how it happened and could not have 
 explained to anyone else 
 how to do it such genius has always seen 
 mysterious and unexplainable 
 a god-given talent possessed by only a 
 few 
 it seems to come and go at will 
 sometimes it's there sometimes it's not 
 because of this 
 many creative people fear their talent 
 will suddenly disappear 
 they don't know how they got it so they 
 have no idea how to 
 recover it if it vanishes creative 
 people often function as channels in 
 only one area of 
 their lives such as one of the arts 
 science 
 or business and may have no idea how to 
 do it in other areas of their lives 
 thus their lives can be terribly out of 
 balance 
 see the section on highly intuitive 
 people in the chapter on trusting 
 intuition 
 this is one reason why we often equate 
 genius with emotional instability i 
 believe we are all geniuses 
 each in our own unique way we 
 will discover the nature of our 
 particular genius when we stop try 
 aim to conform to our own or other 
 people's models 
 learn to be ourselves and allow our 
 natural channel to open 
 through trust in and acting on our 
 intuition 
 it's possible to bring our natural 
 creative inspiration into every moment 
 in every area of our lives when i speak 
 of a channel 
 i have an image of a long round pipe 
 with energy flowing through it 
 it's somewhat like the pie pin a pipe 
 organ 
 with the music coming through this 
 channel image has three 
 important features one it is open and 
 unobstructed inside so that the energy 
 can 
 move through freely 2. it has a definite 
 physical form 
 a structure surrounds the open space so 
 that the energy is directed in a 
 particular way 
 without this structure the energy would 
 be free-floating 
 without any focus 3. 
 it has a power source something that 
 moves energy 
 through the channel in a pipe organ the 
 power source 
 the organ sends energy through the open 
 pipes 
 the particular combination of open space 
 inside each pipe in the structure the 
 size and shape of the 
 pipe causes a certain node to be sounded 
 the power source is 
 the same for all the pipes and the 
 energy moving through them is 
 the same but because each one is a 
 different shape 
 each one makes a unique sound 
 we can think of ourselves as channels 
 similar to these pipes 
 we have a common power source the 
 universal life force 
 and the same creative energy flows 
 through each of us 
 our body emperor sonality form the 
 structure that determines the unique 
 direction 
 and function of each of us as a channel 
 it is up to us to keep our 
 channel open and clear and to build and 
 maintain a strong 
 healthy beautiful body personality 
 structure as a vehicle for our creative 
 energy we can do this by constantly 
 tuning in 
 asking where the energy wants to go 
 and moving with it a strong body 
 personality structure is not created by 
 follow 
 anybody else's rules or good ideas about 
 what you should eat 
 how you should exercise or anything else 
 it is created primarily by 
 trusting your intuition and learning to 
 follow its direction 
 when deciding what to eat how to 
 exercise or anything else gather infer 
 matian from reliable sources then check 
 in with yourself to see 
 what feels intuitively right for you and 
 do your best to follow your 
 own inner guidance most of us have had 
 occasional experiences of trusting our 
 intuition and having things work out in 
 amazing ways 
 the fall lowing true story is a good 
 example of this 
 a few years ago my editor 
 becky had achieved what many people 
 think of as the 
 american dream she had a husband and 
 daughter 
 a good job money in the bank and owned 
 her own home 
 yet she felt an emptiness inside 
 she felt an inner prompting to leave her 
 job and pursue a career 
 in publishing her husband did not 
 support this idea 
 in fact he pointed out that she didn't 
 have the formal education necessary 
 to obtain a position in a publishing 
 house becky and her husband eventually 
 separated 
 and she decided to make a move she had 
 been reading many books 
 including living in the light and knew 
 that she 
 wanted to work for a pub lisher in the 
 field of personal growth 
 her intuitive feeling was that she 
 needed to move to northern california 
 it was the most difficult and courageous 
 step she had ever taken 
 she found herself in a new community 
 with no friends 
 no job and no money she had no luck 
 at first obtaining a publishing job and 
 so she looked for any kind of work that 
 would enable her to soar 
 vive many times she questioned her 
 choice to take such a risk 
 yet she kept feeling a deep sense that 
 she was on the right track 
 finally she found work in another field 
 she was able to get back on her feet 
 financially and she regained her 
 confidence 
 she continued her search for a 
 publishing job 
 and this time she was successful 
 she happily took a cut in pay and 
 position to take an 
 entry-level job at new world library the 
 company she had 
 always hoped to work for finally she 
 felt 
 she was at home as of this writing 
 becky has been with new world library 
 for six years 
 she has her dream job as the editorial 
 director 
 by following her inner guidance even 
 through very difficult 
 times she found the perfect place to 
 express her creativity and 
 make her contribution to the world you 
 may have had a similar experience 
 where listening to your intuition about 
 something proved so fruitful and 
 fulfilling 
 if so the next step is to become more 
 conscious of the process 
 so you can recognize when you are 
 following the flow of energy 
 as opposed to blocking fighting 
 or trying to control it the more 
 willing you are to surrender to the 
 energy within you the more 
 power can flow through you i know most 
 of us have had experiences 
 at certain times when we've felt life 
 energy 
 wisdom and power flow through us when we 
 have felt momentarily enlightened we 
 have a brief moment of 
 clarity and power and then it goes away 
 again 
 when it goes away we feel lost and 
 unsure of ourselves 
 the more you practice trusting and 
 following your intuition 
 the more consistently you will feel that 
 sense of flow 
 at these times you may find yourself 
 right where you want to be at every 
 moment you'll be where the energy is the 
 greatest for you 
 doing what you want to do and watching 
 miracles being accomplished 
 your energy may have a transformational 
 effect on others 
 as well as you strengthen the commitment 
 to trusting yourself 
 every thing in your life may change 
 at first as you begin to let go of 
 your old patterns it may appear that 
 things in your life are falling 
 apart you may find that you have to let 
 go of certain things you've 
 been attached to some relationships in 
 your life may dissolve or 
 simply fizzle out from lack of energy 
 old pastimes may know 
 longer interest you you may even lose 
 your job or decide to leave it 
 of course these changes can be upsetting 
 and frightening 
 over time however you will find that 
 this is all part of the 
 transformation you are going through as 
 you learn to be true too 
 yourself you will find that you attract 
 people 
 work and other sir come stances that 
 reflect your evolution and development 
 maintaining your focus in order to live 
 fully and creatively 
 it's important to stay focused on 
 following your own energy 
 this focus allows your channel to remain 
 open to the energy flowing through 
 it's so easy to lose your focus to get 
 lost in other people 
 external goals and desires 
 and the problem is we do exactly that we 
 lose our con 
 connection with ourselves as long as we 
 are overly focused on the out 
 side there will always be an empty 
 hungry lost place inside that 
 needs to be filled if i'm in love with 
 someone and begin to think of him as my 
 source of joy then i lose myself i have 
 to remind myself that the 
 source of joy and love is already within 
 me that i am experiencing 
 love externally only because it is 
 inside me 
 i try to keep the focus on the universe 
 within and at the same time feel the 
 universe calm 
 in through my lover to me for me it's a 
 constant discipline to remember to go 
 back 
 inside to connect with my intuition i'll 
 remind myself regularly 
 during the day to do this if i find 
 myself getting lost in my outer 
 activities i'll check back inside to see 
 if i'm being true to my feel 
 inks this keeps the flow of the universe 
 moving through me 
 as we learn to pay attention to our 
 intuitive feelings 
 follow our own energy and live our truth 
 we find that we feel more and more of 
 the life force moving through us 
 that feeling of greater aliveness is so 
 wonderful that it becomes our major 
 focus and 
 source of fulfillment we feel less 
 attached to the externals of our lives 
 whether war not things go as we have 
 planned 
 seems less important when we feel that 
 our satisfaction is coming primarily 
 from 
 sustaining our connection to our own 
 life energy 
 ironically when we stay true to 
 ourselves in this way 
 the externals of our lives reflect our 
 inner integrity 
 we attract to us and create around us 
 exactly what our 
 hearts and souls truly desire living as 
 a channel 
 channeling works in two ways energy 
 either flows through 
 you to others or from others to you for 
 example 
 as i write my book i focus on the energy 
 flowing from the universe through me 
 to others then when people say to me 
 i just love your books they've changed 
 my life 
 i am conscious of appreciation coming 
 from them to me 
 and through me back to the universal 
 source 
 as you become increasingly conscious of 
 the flow of life mouth 
 ink through you and through everything 
 and everyone else your 
 body will become capable of channeling 
 more energy 
 the more energy you are willing to 
 receive 
 the more you'll be able to give to 
 become a clear channel for the universe 
 presents the high 
 a state challenge and offers the 
 greatest potential joy and fulfillment 
 for every human being being a channel 
 means living fully and 
 passionately in the world having deep 
 relationships 
 playing work in creating 
 enjoying money and material possessions 
 being your 
 self yet maintaining your profound 
 connection with the power of 
 the universe within you learning and 
 growing from every experience 
 ants that you have then you can watch 
 the universe create through you 
 it can use you to do its work 
 living as a channel is an ongoing 
 learning process that's available to 
 anyone who is willing to make the inner 
 commitment group channeling as we 
 develop the ability to trust and follow 
 our intuition 
 we learn to open and strengthen our 
 individual channel so we can 
 bring more power creativity and love 
 through us 
 when we come together in a relationship 
 or in a group 
 each individual channel becomes part of 
 a bigger channel 
 a group channel is created that is more 
 powerful than any of us can be 
 individually 
 when many bodies and minds are willing 
 to surrender open 
 up and grow these combined energies 
 create a very strong 
 open structure that allows a lot more 
 energy to come through from the 
 universe the process intensifies 
 tremendously and everyone gets a 
 powerful boost from the energy which is 
 capable of pushing 
 each of us to the next level of our 
 growth even though we may all 
 be in somewhat different places and 
 going through different 
 things each person receives the 
 inspiration the support 
 the push or whatever is needed to enable 
 them to take the next step on their 
 journey a group channel can open us up 
 to a deeper level of 
 awareness and in the process we share 
 more of ourselves and find 
 that we are healed of things that have 
 held us back 
 this is one reason i love teaching 
 workshops and working with 
 groups my friends call me an energy 
 junkie because i'm always 
 attracted to situations where the energy 
 is most intense and expand 
 civ i love the way my personal growth 
 process is accelerated by 
 the intensification that happens in 
 groups 
 i have found that in leading a group i 
 usually need to start 
 with a certain amount of structure and 
 take responsibility to clear 
 lie maintain the leader position as the 
 group continues 
 i can let go of the structure more and 
 more and gradually allow the spawn 
 tiniest energy of the group to take over 
 as everyone surrenders and opens up 
 the group channel is formed this process 
 can be confusing and chaotic at times 
 because as the leader i am no longer in 
 control in the usual sense 
 of the word it can arouse my fears and 
 everyone else's 
 but i find that when i'm willing to move 
 through the fears 
 something power full and beautiful 
 emerges through the group channel 
 the universe leads us into new places 
 and new discoveries that we would not 
 have 
 had an opportunity to experience if we 
 had stayed within a more 
 formal structure i find the process of 
 group channeling very exit 
 in and rewarding in a sense everyone 
 living on this planet is a part of a 
 gigantic 
 group channel the mass consciousness of 
 humanity 
 this world as it is now is the creation 
 of the group channel 
 as each one of us individually 
 surrenders to the power of the universe 
 and allows that 
 power to transform and enlighten us the 
 group channel is affected 
 accordingly the mass consciousness 
 becomes more and more 
 evolved this is how i see our world 
 being transformed 
 meditation sit or lie down in a 
 comfortable position 
 close your eyes take a deep breath and 
 relax your body 
 take another deep breath and relax your 
 mind 
 continue to breathe slowly and deeply 
 and let go 
 of all tension or anxiety as you relax 
 you find yourself in a deep quiet place 
 inside 
 allow yourself to just rest in that 
 place for a few 
 moments with nothing you need to do or 
 think about 
 from this deep quiet place begin to 
 sense the life force with 
 in you imagine that you are following 
 your own energy 
 feeling it trusting it moving with it in 
 every moment of your life 
 you are being completely true to 
 yourself 
 speaking and living your truth you feel 
 alive and empowered 
 imagine that you are expressing your 
 creativity fully and freely 
 and let yourself enjoy that experience 
 bye 
 being who you are and expressing 
 yourself you are having a heel 
 in an empowering effect on everyone you 
 encounter and on the 
 world around you chapter 5 
 exploring our many selves we are all 
 born with an infinite number of 
 different qualities 
 or energies within us one of our most 
 important tasks in life is 
 to discover and develop as many of these 
 energies as possible 
 so that we can be well-rounded and 
 experience the full range of our 
 potential we can think of these energies 
 as different archetypes 
 super sonalities or selves within us 
 in a way it's as if there are many diff 
 different characters living inside of us 
 each with its own task and purpose 
 since the physical world is a plane of 
 duality for each of 
 these energies within us there is an 
 opposite energy 
 in order to experience wholeness and 
 balance 
 we need to develop indentee 55 
 great both sides of every polarity most 
 of us 
 however are not accustomed to thinking 
 in this 
 way we have been taught to think in a 
 linear 
 exclusive fashion good bad 
 right wrong so if one quality is good or 
 desirable 
 it's opposite is bad or undesirable 
 for example many of us have been taught 
 that it is virtuous 
 and admirable to give to others a person 
 who gives a lot is a good 
 person therefore taking is thought to be 
 selfish 
 a person who takes a lot for himself 
 might be judged as less worthy than a 
 give 
 in person someone else with different 
 values might think of this 
 in an opposite way he might admire a 
 person who knows how to take 
 a lot for himself and think of that 
 person as smart and successful 
 while looking down on someone who is 
 less aggressive and more 
 giving as being foolish and easily taken 
 advantage of 
 either way one polarity is honored while 
 the opposite is devol 
 ud in reality both giving and receiving 
 are equally important and 
 valuable if we give too much and aren't 
 able to take or receive 
 equally we become depleted and resentful 
 if we take too much and are unable to 
 give 
 we lose the satisfaction of making a 
 contri 
 buttion and incur the resentment of 
 others 
 if we can give and receive more or less 
 imbalance 
 we experience a healthy sense of 
 satisfaction 
 from the time we are born we begin to 
 experiment with 
 expressing the different energies within 
 us at that time we are 
 completely dependent on our parents or 
 caretakers for our survival 
 and well-being so we are extremely 
 sensitive to their reactions too to 
 us if we express an energy that invokes 
 approval and positive 
 attention we are likely to continue to 
 develop that quality 
 on the other hand if something we do 
 draws disapproval 
 criticism or punishment we are likely to 
 discontinue it 
 unless that is the only form of 
 attention we can get 
 in which case we may continue it fairly 
 soon 
 we have a pretty good sense of which 
 energies help 
 us get our needs met and which ones seem 
 to cause us 
 more prob limbs than they are worth 
 this varies greatly according to each 
 individual 
 family system time period and culture 
 as we grow up we continue to develop the 
 energies that seem 
 to work best to meet our needs we become 
 very identified with 
 these qualities that's who we think we 
 are these dominant inner 
 keys become our primary selves the inner 
 characters whose job 
 it is to take care of us and make our 
 lives work as well as possible 
 there are usually a group of primary 
 selves who work together 
 er as a team making most of our 
 decisions for us 
 for example some of my primary selves 
 are the super responsible one 
 the pleaser who wants to make everyone 
 happy so they will like me 
 the pusher who wants me to work hard and 
 accomplish a lot 
 the caretaking mother who takes care of 
 the child in other people so 
 that they'll feel good with me the 
 consciousness teacher 
 healer there are a number of others on 
 the team as well 
 they have all worked very hard to make 
 me a worthy 
 well-loved and successful person 
 for every primary self there is an 
 opposite energy 
 which oftentimes has been repressed or 
 denied because one way or anoth 
 or we got the message that it was not 
 okay or because it simply has 
 and had space to develop these energies 
 become our disowned 
 cells they are usually buried within our 
 psyche and we either 
 don't know about them at all or we are 
 aware of them and try to 
 hide them from the world the disowned 
 selves make up our shad 
 outside the parts of ourselves that we 
 are embarrassed about ashamed of 
 fearful of or uncomfortable with our 
 primary selves 
 are usually working hard to make sure 
 that we don't show these dis 
 own selves to the world since they are 
 convinced that this would 
 invite criticism rejection abandonment 
 or some form of disaster the problem is 
 that each of these disowned selves 
 carries 
 an essential energy that is an important 
 part of us 
 in fact we are often in desperate need 
 of these qualities in order to bring 
 healing 
 and balance into our lives as long as we 
 fear our shadow side 
 however we can't access the energies 
 that we need 
 for example if one of your primary 
 selves is power 
 and you are very identified with being 
 strong 
 competent and independent it is very 
 likely that you have disowned your 
 vulnerable side 
 the part of you that feels dependent on 
 others and has needs for love 
 and support from the point of view of 
 your power primary self 
 your vulnerable side might seem 
 disgusting and way too danger 
 also show to the world for fear of being 
 hurt you might be 
 completely unconscious of having a 
 vulnerable side or you might 
 be aware of it but not want others to 
 see it for fear of their jug 
 meant strangely you will find that you 
 are constantly attracting 
 vulnerable people into your life and you 
 may at times feel very 
 judgmental toward them for being so weak 
 believe it or not 
 you need to consciously accept and own 
 your vulnerable side 
 without it you cannot have real intimacy 
 and 
 closeness with others and you can't 
 really receive 
 you're out of touch with a very 
 important part of your human experience 
 life has an amazing way of confronting 
 us with and reflect 
 into us the exact energies that we need 
 to discover within our 
 selves and integrate into our lives this 
 happens through our 
 dreams where we are often shown 
 symbolically the relationships 
 between our primary selves and its own 
 selves 
 it happens con stantly in our 
 relationships 
 where others reflect to us a various 
 different selves within us 
 our imbalances show up in every area of 
 our lives from our health to our 
 finances how do we become conscious of 
 the many selves within and 
 bring them into balance in our lives the 
 first and most important step 
 is to begin to recognize and become 
 aware of our primary selves 
 what qualities and energies are you most 
 identified with 
 can you begin to notice the selves 
 within you that 
 automatically make most of your 
 decisions and 
 run your life we want to honor and 
 appreciate our primary selves for how 
 much they've done for us while 
 separating a bit from being total 
 lie identified with them as soon as we 
 become conscious of them 
 as energies within us rather than who we 
 are we are beginning to 
 develop what is called aware ego aware 
 ego is the ability to 
 recognize and hold all the different 
 selves within us 
 so that we the ideas and terminology in 
 this chapter 
 including the concepts of primary selves 
 disowned selves 
 and aware ego are derived from the work 
 of drs 
 hal and citrus stone the psychology of 
 selves and the voice dialogue technique 
 for more information of their work i 
 highly recommend their books and tapes 
 listed in recommended resources 
 can have conscious choice about which 
 ones we bring through at 
 any given moment once we have some 
 awareness in relation to our primary 
 selves 
 the disowned selves start to come forth 
 the primary selves usual 
 lie remain our strongest qualities but 
 we begin to feel more balanced 
 and our lives begin to work better as we 
 begin to integrate the inner 
 g from previously disowned selves the 
 disidentification with the 
 primary selves the development of aware 
 ego 
 and the acknowledge ing of the disowned 
 selves is a gradual process that happens 
 over a 
 lifetime every step we take in this 
 process 
 however can make a big difference in our 
 lives 
 our intuitive wisdom is one of the 
 energies ourselves within us 
 if we were encouraged to trust our 
 intuition at an early age 
 or had an intuitive parent figure is an 
 early role model 
 our intuition may be a primary self 
 since our culture tends to deny or 
 devalue the 
 intuitive function however for most of 
 us it is a disowned oral 
 actively underdeveloped self while 
 rationality is usually one of the 
 primary selves if rationality is a 
 primary self 
 and intuition is disowned in order to 
 get in touch with our inner guidance 
 we may need to sep air it from over 
 identification with our rational side 
 we do this by recognizing it as one 
 aspect of who we are 
 and beginning to notice how it operates 
 in our lives 
 once we become more aware of it in this 
 way 
 we are no longer so identified with it 
 and we can begin to 
 have more conscious choice about how and 
 when we use it 
 this creates space to explore our 
 intuitive side as well 
 if intuition is a primary self we may 
 have difficulty thinking 
 logically or dealing with practical 
 matters in a grounded way 
 in this case we may need to develop our 
 rational 
 practical side in order to ground our 
 intuition in the physical world 
 owning our shadow side there is a simple 
 universal principle 
 everything in the universe wants to be 
 accepted 
 all aspects of creation want to be loved 
 appreciated and included so any quality 
 or energy that you are 
 not allowing yourself to experience or 
 express will keep coming up 
 inside of you or around you until you 
 recognize it as a part of you 
 until you accept it and integrate it 
 into your personality and your 
 life many people who are involved in 
 personal growth become very 
 identified with the energies and 
 qualities that they think of as being 
 spiritual peaceful loving giving 
 and so on in attempting to develop these 
 aspects of themselves 
 they often deny and disown other aspects 
 that they consider to be unspiritual 
 aggression assertiveness gun level 
 honesty 
 human vulnerability unfortunately 
 this simply creates a huge shadow side 
 within them 
 which contributes to the collective 
 shadow of denied energies in 
 our world for some it can be quite 
 shocking to realize that if we over 
 identify with peace and love and disown 
 our inner warrior 
 we are not contributing to world peace 
 quite the opposite in fact if we 
 don't own our inner warrior and channel 
 him in a constructive way 
 in our lives he retreats into the 
 shadows of our individual 
 and call elective psyche and actually 
 contributes to the perpetuation of 
 war on our planet if we truly want inner 
 peace and world peace 
 we must do the difficult but fascinating 
 work of owning and appreciating all 
 aspects of who we are truly making peace 
 with ourselves 
 real consciousness involves holding both 
 sides of any polarity 
 not identifying with one exploring and 
 embracing our darkness is the 
 only way we can truly live in the light 
 meditation 
 get in a comfort herbal position in a 
 quiet place 
 bring to mind one of your main 
 personality characteristics or primary 
 selves 
 get a sense in your body of how that 
 energy feels 
 now imagine an opposite energy which may 
 be disowned or less developed in you 
 imagine what that energy would feel like 
 what would be the pause 
 active benefits of developing more 
 ability to contact that energy 
 how could that bring more balance into 
 your life 
 see if you can feel a balance of both of 
 those energies at the 
 same time for example if you are an 
 outgoing person 
 you might balance that with a quieter 
 more introspective energy if you are 
 hardworking you might balance that with 
 the energy of relaxation 
 or playfulness chapter 6 
 the world as our mirror t he physical 
 world is our creation 
 we each create our own verb sign of the 
 world 
 our particular reality our unique life 
 experience 
 because i am creating my life i can look 
 at my creation to get feed 
 back about myself just as an artist 
 looks at his latest creation too 
 see what works well and what doesn't and 
 thereby improves his 
 skills we can look at the ongoing 
 masterwork of our lives too 
 appreciate who we are and to recognize 
 what we still need to learn 
 we're creating our lives as we go along 
 therefore 
 our expiry answers give us an instant 
 ongoing reflection of ourselves in fact 
 the external world is like a giant 
 mirror that reflects our consciousness 
 clearly and accurately once we have 
 learned how to look into that 
 63. mirror and perceive and interpret 
 its reflection 
 we have a fabulous tool for 
 self-awareness 
 understanding that the world is our 
 mirror can help us see our 
 lives as a reflection of our beliefs 
 attitudes and emotional 
 pat turns viewed in this way 
 the external world can teach us about 
 hidden aspects of ourselves that we 
 can't see directly 
 the process is based on two premises 
 1. i assume that everything in my life 
 is my reflection 
 micro ashen there are no accidents or 
 events that are unrelated to me 
 if i see or feel something if it has any 
 impact on me 
 then my soul has attracted or created it 
 to show me something 
 if it didn't mere or some part of myself 
 i wouldn't even be able to see it all 
 the 
 people in my life are reflections of the 
 various characters and dinner 
 geez that live inside of me 2. 
 i always try to avoid putting myself 
 down for the reflections 
 i see i know that nothing is negative 
 everything is a gift that brings me to 
 self-awareness 
 after all i'm here to learn if i was 
 already perfect i wouldn't be here why 
 should i get angry at 
 myself when i see things i've been 
 unconscious of it would be like 
 a first grader getting frustrated 
 because she wasn't in college yet 
 i try to maintain a compassionate 
 attitude toward myself and my 
 learning process to the extent that i 
 can do this 
 the learning process becomes fun and 
 really quite interesting 
 i am learning to view my life as a 
 fascinating and adventurous 
 movie all the characters in it are parts 
 of me played out on the big 
 screen so that i can clearly see them 
 once i see them and recognize 
 their various feelings and voices inside 
 myself 
 i can understand that they are all 
 important and valuable parts of me that 
 i need for 
 my full expression in this life if the 
 movie portrays problems 
 hassles or struggles i know i 
 must check inside to find out where i'm 
 not being true to myself 
 or have more learning and healing to do 
 i also know that when i'm 
 trusting and being myself as fully as 
 possible 
 everything in my life reflects this by 
 falling into place easily and working 
 smoothly 
 problems are messages if there are 
 problems in your life 
 the universe is trying to get your 
 attention 
 it's saying hey there's something you 
 need to be 
 aware of something that needs to be 
 changed here 
 if you pay attention to the small 
 signals 
 you will learn from them but if you 
 don't 
 the problems will intensify until you 
 get the message and 
 start to pay attention if you accept 
 that every time a problem 
 occurs the universe is showing you 
 something you will make 
 rapid progress on your journey of 
 self-discovery 
 when something negative happens it's 
 tempting to say 
 why does this happen to me i'm doing the 
 best i can but not 
 ing seems to be going right i can't 
 understand why i keep having 
 this problem if you find yourself doing 
 this 
 try to open up to another way of looking 
 at things 
 go inside and say to the universe i know 
 you're trying to show me something 
 help me understand what it is 
 after you do this let go of focusing on 
 it and go about your 
 life but stay open to the message that 
 will be coming 
 through it may come in the form of an 
 inner feeling or awareness 
 some words from a friend or something 
 unexpected that happens to 
 you the message may come through 
 immediately or it may take 
 quite a while one of my clients was 
 fired 
 quite unexpectedly over two years ago 
 at first he was devastated but after a 
 few months 
 of getting his bearings he went into 
 business on his own 
 his business is now doing very well 
 but it was only a few weeks ago that he 
 understood the message that his firing 
 reflected 
 as he was talking to a friend about 
 working for other people 
 he suddenly realized that the firing 
 incident was trying to tell him that he 
 was 
 ready to be in business for himself 
 rather than working for other 
 people for him this realization not only 
 affirmed his present 
 course in life but it also finally 
 resolved the sense of failure about 
 being fired that had lingered with him 
 since the incident 
 interpreting the reflection the 
 trickiest part of using the mirror 
 process is learning how 
 to interpret the reflection you see once 
 you do get a message 
 but you are not quite sure what it is 
 how do you find out it will not help to 
 overanalyze or obsess about it with your 
 rational mind it is far more effective 
 to turn to your intuitive self 
 to ask the universe for help simply sit 
 quietly 
 take a few deep breaths and focus your 
 awareness within 
 to the wise part of you that is in touch 
 with the wisdom of the universe 
 ask this part either silently or out 
 loud 
 for guidance or help in understanding 
 the message 
 as you tune into your gut feelings and 
 get a sense of 
 what feels right in the moment act on 
 this feeling 
 after acting on the feeling try to be 
 aware of the external end 
 internal feedback from your actions the 
 external feedback is how 
 well things work do things seem to fall 
 into place and work eosy 
 like then you're surely in tune with 
 your inner guidance 
 if you're struggling to do something 
 that doesn't happen easily 
 it's sage to let go and check back in to 
 find out what you really want 
 to be doing internal feedback will come 
 to you as feelings 
 if you feel empowered more alive 
 then it's right the ultimate key is 
 aliveness 
 the more the universe moves through you 
 the more alive you feel 
 conversely every time you don't follow 
 your inner guidance you 
 feel a loss of energy loss of power a 
 sense of spiritual or emotional deadness 
 in being true to yourself you will feel 
 more alive but you may 
 also feel uncomfortable this is because 
 you are risking change 
 as you undergo certain changes you may 
 experience various intents 
 emotions such as fear grief or anger 
 allow these emotions experts scion 
 after all your inner guidance has to 
 move through years of 
 accumulated unconsciousness denial doubt 
 and fear so let your feelings come up 
 and wash through you 
 you are being cleaned out and healed 
 at times like this it is very important 
 to have emotional 
 support and a safe place to explore your 
 feelings and do your heel 
 in process if possible i recommend 
 finding a good therapist or 
 support group an environment where you 
 are encouraged and 
 supported in experiencing your own 
 feelings and needs 
 expressing yourself honestly and 
 trusting your own sense of what's right 
 for 
 you when you are growing and changing 
 rapidly 
 your inner doubts and fears will often 
 be reflected in the reactions of those 
 around you if your friends and family 
 question or judge the 
 changes in you recognize that they are 
 simply mirroring the doubt 
 in fearful voices in you such as 
 what if i'm doing the wrong thing can i 
 really trust this process 
 respond to such feedback from others in 
 whatever way you 
 feel is appropriate reassure them ignore 
 them 
 argue with them whatever the important 
 thing is to recognize that you are 
 really 
 dealing with your own inner fears the 
 conflicts you may experie 
 ants with others are mirroring the 
 conflicts within yourself 
 between the parts of you that want to 
 grow and change and those 
 that feel safer to do things the way 
 you've always done them 
 affirm that you are learning to trust 
 yourself more and more 
 you will be amazed to see how frequently 
 others will begin to mirror 
 you're increasing self trust and 
 confidence by responding to you 
 with trust and confidence here are some 
 ways that the mirror of life reflects 
 us if you judge and criticize yourself 
 others will judge and criticize you 
 if you hurt yourself others will hurt 
 you 
 if you lie to yourself others will lie 
 to you 
 if you are irresponsible to yourself 
 others will be 
 irresponsible in relation to you if you 
 blame yourself 
 others will blame you if you do violence 
 to yourself emotionally 
 others will do violence to you 
 emotionally 
 or even physically if you don't listen 
 to your feelings 
 no one will listen to your feelings 
 if you love yourself others will love 
 you 
 if you respect yourself others will 
 respect you 
 if you trust yourself others will trust 
 you 
 if you are honest with yourself others 
 will be honest 
 with you if you are gentle and 
 compassionate with yourself 
 others will treat you with compassion 
 if you appreciate yourself others will 
 appreciate you 
 if you honor yourself others will honor 
 you 
 if you enjoy yourself others will enjoy 
 you 
 changing old patterns it's very 
 important to realize that you may not be 
 able to 
 change your old patterns overnight 
 sometimes things seem to 
 change rapidly once you've recognized 
 the message 
 but sometimes it seems like you keep 
 doing the same thing and getting the 
 same 
 unpleasant results long after you feel 
 you know better 
 it takes time for the personality to 
 change its habits 
 so you may have to watch the same old 
 movie repeat itself a few more times 
 if you feel your progress is too slow 
 ask the universe for help 
 and reach out for human help as well by 
 finding a therapist or sup 
 port group change happens not by trying 
 to make yourself 
 change but by becoming conscious of 
 what's not working 
 you can then ask your higher self for 
 help in releasing the old and bringing 
 in 
 the new pattern remember the darkest 
 hour is just before the 
 dawn change often occurs just when 
 you've given up 
 or when you least expect it 
 using the mirror process in using the 
 world as your mirror 
 you must deal with the external 
 realities of your life in whatever way 
 you need to handle 
 them but as soon as possible before 
 during or after you deal with the 
 externals 
 check inside to find out what is being 
 shown to you 
 for example if someone is angry at you 
 and blames or critty 
 sizes you you may need to say to them 
 stop blaming me 
 i don't want to hear your judgments and 
 criticisms of me 
 if you can talk about your own feelings 
 i'll be glad to listen but if you keep 
 attacking me i'm going to leave if they 
 take more responsibility 
 for their feelings for example i felt 
 hurt and angry when you 
 didn't call me yesterday then you will 
 probably be able to con 
 continue the conversation on a more 
 productive level 
 if they can't uh to blame you and focus 
 on your faults 
 you may need to support yourself by 
 walking out of the room and refusing to 
 con 
 continue the conversation until they 
 stop their attack 
 either way you have handled the external 
 situation 
 now as soon as you get a chance 
 check inside yourself and ask i wonder 
 what this person's anger is mirroring in 
 me you may realize that 
 you have been feeling very angry and 
 critical toward yourself late 
 lie or perhaps you will discover that a 
 part of you is upset because 
 you haven't been paying enough attention 
 to yourself 
 when other people want more from you 
 it's usually an indication that you want 
 more from yourself it may in fact be a 
 signal that it's time to show 
 up and be more present with your own 
 needs and feelings 
 interestingly other people in our lives 
 often start feeling better 
 when we become more present with 
 ourselves a friend of mine discovered 
 that her boyfriend had been see 
 in another woman and lying to her about 
 it she was very hurt and 
 angry particularly to discover the 
 dishonesty 
 they had a long talk in which she was 
 able to express her feelings to him 
 then she took some time alone for a 
 while to sort things out on her own 
 when she was alone she asked herself is 
 there some way i'm 
 lying to myself some way i'm not being 
 totally truthful and honest 
 with myself that would cause me to 
 attract a dishonest man 
 she let go of thinking about it and went 
 to work 
 by the end of the day she realized she 
 had often felt this man was not fully 
 present with 
 her was not being real with her but in 
 the past 
 she had denied and covered up these 
 feelings because she was afraid to 
 confront him 
 with what she felt and intuitively knew 
 thus 
 she effectively lied to herself and 
 supported him in his deceptions as well 
 she realized this was a lesson in 
 learning to trust her feelings 
 more and to have the courage to express 
 and support them 
 she started to do this more with her 
 boyfriend 
 and they eventually worked out a more 
 honest 
 communicative relationship she might 
 also have chosen not to continue the 
 relationship 
 what matters is that she received the 
 gift from it 
 learning to trust and express her 
 feelings 
 if you are emotionally triggered by 
 something a person does 
 the two of you are probably mirrors for 
 each other 
 it may appear that you have opposing 
 viewpoints 
 but internally you are probably similar 
 one of you is acting out one side of the 
 internal conflict 
 while the other plays out the other side 
 for example 
 one person may want more commitment in a 
 relationship 
 while the other wants more freedom they 
 become 
 extremely polarized on this issue and 
 truly believe they want oppo 
 cite things however if one person 
 suddenly switches her position 
 the one who wanted commitment suddenly 
 wants freedom the 
 other person often swings to the 
 opposite polarity 
 the reason for this is that they are 
 attempting to resolve an inner conflict 
 they 
 both have the desire for closeness and 
 security and the need for 
 independence and autonomy which may feel 
 like the fear of loan 
 linus versus the fear of entrapment once 
 people look inside and become more aware 
 of their feel 
 inks they often recognize that they have 
 simply projected their 
 inner conflict onto the outside world so 
 that they could recognize 
 and deal with it if a person truly and 
 unequivocally wants a calm 
 mitted relationship he will simply 
 attract another person who 
 wants the same thing if someone feels 
 completely clear about 
 wanting to explore being with many 
 partners he simply does it 
 by using the mirror process you can 
 recognize what you really feel 
 and learn to be more honest with 
 yourself once you recognize an 
 internal conflict you can acknowledge 
 that both polarities are real 
 lie within you and find ways to honor 
 both of the energies 
 4. example we all contain the polarities 
 of desiring closeness in riola 
 shinships while also desiring 
 independence and autonomy 
 as khan says beings we must learn to 
 satisfy both these needs 
 by honoring both of these energies 
 within us 
 we can learn to create relationships in 
 which we have both closeness and 
 independence seeing the world as your 
 mirror also gives you wonderful 
 opportunities to receive positive 
 feedback think of everything 
 that you like and enjoy about your life 
 right now 
 you created these things they are also 
 your mirrors 
 think of the people you know whom you 
 love 
 enjoy respect and admire they are your 
 mirrors they couldn't even be in your 
 life if they didn't reflect 
 you you would not be able to recognize 
 their positive qualities if 
 you didn't have similar ones think of 
 the people and animals that 
 love you they are a mirror of how you 
 love yourself 
 if you have a home that you love or a 
 particular spot in nature that is very 
 beautiful to you it is a mirror of your 
 own beauty 
 when you see beauty anywhere it's a 
 reflection of yourself 
 there are mirrors everywhere whoever you 
 have a connection 
 with is a mirror for you and the deeper 
 the connection 
 the stronger the mirror part of the 
 fascination in using the mirror 
 process is discovering who we are 
 through these external reflections 
 the key is to always go back inside to 
 discover the meaning 
 of the reflection for you the more you 
 are willing to do 
 that without either rationalizing away 
 what you see or blaming yourself 
 for it the faster you can develop and 
 express the multifaceted 
 potential within you meditation 
 relax and close your eyes take a few 
 deep 
 slow breaths and move into a deep place 
 inside of you 
 bring to your mind an important person 
 or thing in your life 
 and ask him slash her slash what it 
 is mirroring to you 
 stay open to receiving the answer 
 whether it 
 comes in words feelings or images 
 it may come immediately or sometime 
 later 
 exercises 1. think of a person you 
 especially love and admire 
 list all their positive qualities 
 think about how those qualities mirror 
 you 
 in some cases they may be qualities you 
 have not fully devil 
 hoped in yourself recognize that this 
 person is here to teach and 
 inspire you by his or her example 2. 
 make a list of the things and people in 
 your life that you 
 especially like praise and appreciate 
 yourself for creating and 
 attracting these mirrors 3. 
 think of someone whom you judge or feel 
 uncomfortable 
 dealt with try to figure out exactly 
 what quality they have that you diss 
 like is it possible that this is a 
 quality within yourself that you 
 deny or judge and that your life could 
 be enhanced if you made 
 peace with and were able to express that 
 part of yourself for example 
 if you dislike someone who appears very 
 selfish they may be 
 reflecting the disowned part of you that 
 wants you to pay more 
 attention to taking care of your own 
 needs perhaps you are 
 over lie identified with taking care of 
 others 
 chapter 7 spirit and form 
 as spirit is the essence of life the 
 energy of the universe that 
 aids all things each one of us is a part 
 of that 
 spirit a divine entity so the spirit is 
 the higher self 
 the eternal being that lives within us 
 form is the physical world as an 
 individual 
 my form is my physical body and my 
 personality 
 which includes my mind and my emotions 
 it is also my self-concept my ego 
 identity struck tor my name is shakti 
 garwin 
 i was born on september 30th 1948. 
 i'm five apostrophe nine tall i'm 
 intelligent and have a generally 
 outgoing 
 personality this is all information 
 about my form 
 we as spiritual beings created the 
 physical world as a place to 
 75. learn it's our school 
 our playground our artist's studio i 
 believe 
 that we're here to master the process of 
 creation and to learn how 
 to integrate all levels of our being 
 spiritual 
 mental emotional and physical 
 so that we can live in the physical 
 world and balance 
 and wholeness physicists are now 
 discovering what metaphysicians have 
 claimed for thousands of years seemingly 
 solid physical matter is 
 in reality made of energy if we look 
 through a powerful micro 
 scope at anything solid we see an 
 infinite number of little 
 vibrating particles if we closely 
 examine one of these particles 
 we discover that it is made of even 
 smaller particles 
 and so on the fact is that 
 everything physical is made of energy 
 which we 
 can also call life force or spirit 
 so modern science supports the ancient 
 metaphysical truth that form is created 
 out of spirit when our spirit decides to 
 manifest as physical form 
 the first thing it creates is a physical 
 body in which to house itself 
 we choose a life situation and create a 
 body in accordance with what 
 we feel will best serve and teach us in 
 this lifetime 
 ultimately our goal is to create a body 
 personality that can fully express our 
 divine 
 creative spirit a form that can do 
 everything our spirit wants to do 
 easily skillfully and beautifully 
 however our physical form body 
 personality 
 has an emperor tant job of its own to do 
 its main responsibility is to make sure 
 that we survive physically and once that 
 is assured 
 that we actual lie thrive physically and 
 emotionally in this life 
 so our forms have a certain 
 consciousness that revolves around 
 making sure we get 
 enough food and shelter protecting 
 ourselves from danger 
 gaining a sense of security by making 
 sure reproduction takes place 
 and offspring survive creating family 
 and community in which we can 
 give and receive the emotional nurturing 
 we need and finding a 
 sense of belonging the energy of our 
 spirit is very different from that of 
 our 
 form our spirit has a very expanded 
 vision and perspective 
 but very little understanding of what it 
 means to be in a human form 
 our form carries our human experience 
 with all its limitations and 
 vulnerabilities and also with the 
 knowledge of how to live in the 
 physical world after we are born into 
 the body 
 most of us forget who we are on the 
 spiritual level and why we came here 
 we take on the sore vital consciousness 
 of the physical world and we get lost in 
 the 
 world of form we forget that we are 
 souls 
 believing we are just our personalities 
 we lose touch with our source of power 
 and feel 
 lost and helpless life becomes a 
 tremendous struggle to find 
 meaning and satisfaction we may spend 
 many lifetimes caught up in this cycle 
 certainly most of us have spent many 
 years in this lifetime looking out 
 beside ourselves trying to find 
 fulfillment in the world of form 
 eventually we realize that it's not 
 working no matter what we 
 do in the world we don't find profound 
 happiness 
 we become unwilling to spend one more 
 lifetime 
 one more year or even one more minute in 
 futile struggle 
 in frustration and hopelessness we 
 give up this is usually a painful and 
 frightening place in a person's life 
 it feels like hitting bottom it is a 
 kind of death of our old 
 identity when the form recognizes the 
 hopelessness of trying to 
 live this way and surrenders its fight 
 it would rather die than keep trying 
 at this time a person often has thoughts 
 and feelings of 
 death or may experience the death of a 
 close friend or 
 family member or several of them 
 some people create a serious illness 
 accident 
 or other major crisis at this time and 
 some contemplate 
 or even attempt suicide but the darkest 
 hour is truly just before the dawn 
 when we finally give up the struggle to 
 find fulfillment out there 
 we have nowhere to go but within it is 
 at this moment of total surrender 
 that a new light begins to dawn when we 
 give up our old way of 
 doing things we create space for a new 
 energy to come through 
 this is like being reborn we are infants 
 in this new world 
 and have no idea how to live since none 
 of our old ways work here 
 we feel uncertain and out of control yet 
 hope is reborn in us 
 and a new power and vision start to come 
 through 
 this can be the beginning of developing 
 a form that is conscious of 
 and integrate ed with our spirit 
 ramdas has a beautiful analogy for this 
 process 
 he likens it two o'clock where twelve 
 o'clock is the starting point 
 from twelve o'clock to three o'clock 
 life is totally lost in the world of 
 form 
 from three o'clock to six o'clock is 
 grad i'll disillusionment with the world 
 and six o'clock is where you hit bottom 
 you feel that you lose everything but as 
 you pass through 
 six o'clock you are actually waking up 
 to reconnecting with spirit 
 from six o'clock back up to 12 o'clock 
 is ever increasing integration of spirit 
 and 
 form as individuals we are at various 
 stages in this process 
 i have a sense that we each have one 
 major cycle of this type lasting over 
 many physical life times and we also 
 have an infinite number of 
 minor cycles sometimes almost daily 
 when we as individuals first rediscover 
 our spirit 
 we are using a lie drawn to nurture and 
 cultivate this awareness 
 this often involves withdrawing from the 
 world to one degree or another 
 and going within for some people this 
 takes the form of spending 
 time in nature for some it involves 
 practicing meditation 
 going to retreats and so forth 
 for some it may be simply finding time 
 to be 
 alone and quiet often it's a time of 
 partial or complete width 
 draw from relationships work and or 
 other attachments that 
 tend to pull us outside of ourselves for 
 some 
 this phase may last only a few weeks or 
 months 
 each of us is unique so we all exp 
 means this shift within in different 
 ways in one way or another 
 we learn to go inside and be in that 
 quieter place in ourselves for a 
 while there we find a deeper and deeper 
 connection with our 
 spirit while we are deeply connected 
 with ourselves in this way 
 we often find that we have a feeling of 
 clarity 
 vision wisdom power and love 
 this is because in that moment we are 
 connected with 
 the expansive energy of spirit and not 
 distracted by the problems 
 and responsibilities of dealing with the 
 world of form 
 if we choose to follow one of the 
 traditional spiritual paths we 
 may remain more or less withdrawn from 
 the world in this way we 
 can be true to our spirit and avoid 
 dealing with the attachments 
 and patterns of our form unfortunately 
 we never have the upper opportunity to 
 fully integrate spirit and form 
 in order to create the new world we are 
 being challenged to 
 move out into the world of form with 
 full spiritual awareness 
 we need to recognize the differences 
 between our spirit and our form 
 and learn to integrate them integrating 
 spirit and form 
 the first step in the process of 
 consciously integrating form 
 and spirit is to be able to recognize 
 and feel both the consciousness 
 of your spirit and the consciousness of 
 your form you may be 
 accustomed to feeling only one of them 
 most of the time fault with 
 occasional flashes of the other or you 
 may flip 
 back and forth frequently between the 
 two perspectives 
 it's as if one takes control of the body 
 for a while and you see things from that 
 viewpoint 
 then the other one takes over and 
 suddenly everything looks 
 quite different this understanding can 
 explain a lot of things that many of us 
 are experiencing in our lives why is it 
 that we have wonderful 
 moments of consciousness and clarity and 
 then find we have calm 
 plately lost our perspective and become 
 immersed in fear and pain 
 again how is it that we can feel so 
 loving 
 wise and accepting one day and the next 
 day feel so angry 
 foolish and judgmental why 
 did we feel like we'd really gotten it 
 at a workshop and then 
 seem to lose it the next day how is it 
 that we can feel so peaceful and 
 unattached when we are meditating yet 
 often our relationships 
 seem like a worse mess than ever and how 
 come we have such 
 trust in the abundance of the universe 
 but we are still having fenin 
 shall problems the answer is simple we 
 are dealing with the discrepancies 
 between spirit and form this is a very 
 difficult thing to confront 
 and we are facing a real challenge many 
 people reach this 
 point and have a hard time going any 
 further 
 for example i frequently get inspiring 
 creative ideas for a new 
 project i want to do i get a very strong 
 vision of how wonderful it will be and 
 how it can work 
 all this is coming from my spirit of 
 course 
 i get very excited and jump into the 
 project making all 
 kinds of plans and initiating many 
 actions in that direction 
 a few days or weeks later i find myself 
 feeling totally overwhelmed 
 over worked frustrated and ready to 
 throw the whole thing out 
 the window my spirit had a true vision 
 but i was trying to achieve it without 
 regard to the needs of my human form 
 at this point i have to stop and 
 consider what's realistic for me 
 then set the pro checked aside for a 
 while 
 or allow it to take longer and develop 
 more slowly 
 my spirit tends to race ahead so it has 
 to learn to go at the 
 pace my form can handle the second step 
 is to love and accept both aspects of 
 yourself 
 they are both beautiful and vital parts 
 of you without your spur 
 it you wouldn't be alive you'd only be a 
 dead body 
 without your form you wouldn't be able 
 to be in this world 
 you'd be existing in some other realm of 
 consciousness 
 it may be frustrating at times to see 
 that your form can't live 
 up to all the ideals that your spirit 
 may have it's important to 
 recognize that our form has its own 
 wisdom and the spirit can 
 learn from the form just as the reverse 
 is true 
 after all we choose to come to this 
 plane of existence in order to 
 experience being 
 human for example many years ago i was 
 living with a man and we 
 had an open relationship in other words 
 we were free to be 
 with other lovers i had a strong 
 spiritual ideal that i could love 
 someone deeply and allow him to be free 
 to follow energy he might 
 feel with someone else while i was free 
 to do likewise 
 sometimes i was able to do this 
 briefly and i had some beautiful moments 
 where i felt an expansive and 
 exhilarating unconditional 
 love but most of the time i was 
 overwhelmed with jealousy and emotional 
 pain i finally realized that my 
 spiritual ideal simply did not fit the 
 reality of my human feelings and needs 
 it became very clear to me 
 that i could only experience the kind of 
 emotional intimacy that i 
 wanted in a monogamous relationship one 
 important key to integrating spirit and 
 form is learning to 
 listen to your intuition and act on it 
 your inner guidance will 
 always move you in the direction of 
 greater balance and integra 
 shin between form and spirit even in the 
 process of learning to 
 trust your inner guidance however you 
 can't move faster than your 
 form is ready to go here is a very 
 important point 
 you cannot force your form to trust and 
 follow intuition through will 
 you must allow it to educate itself 
 through conscious observation 
 in other words you can't force yourself 
 to always follow your 
 intuitive feelings even though you 
 desire to live that way 
 some times it may seem like too big a 
 risk 
 even though your spirit knows it would 
 work out 
 your form is too afraid to do it don't 
 push 
 yourself past what you are ready to do 
 simply observe the process 
 and be honest with yourself about how it 
 feels and what happens 
 then the change will happen naturally 
 and spontaneously 
 for example suppose you are with a 
 friend and there's some 
 thing you want to say but you are afraid 
 to do so for fear your 
 friend will get hurt angry and reject 
 you if you find you do 
 have the courage go ahead and say what 
 you feel 
 then observe what happens and how you 
 feel as a result 
 chances are good that you will feel 
 energized and empowered by the 
 experience 
 if on the other hand you are too afraid 
 to speak the truth 
 don't try to push yourself past your 
 fear again 
 simply observe yourself being with your 
 friend and not being totally yourself 
 notice that you feel deadness and loss 
 of energy you may also feel 
 resentful toward your friend try not to 
 judge yourself for your lack 
 of action remember this is a learning 
 process 
 the spirit usually tends toward 
 expansiveness risk taking 
 and change the form often tends are 
 toward what it perceives to be safe 
 thai security and the status quo because 
 its basic task is to make sure 
 we survive and it fears that change 
 might mean disaster or death 
 if you are able to observe yourself 
 without rationalization or 
 judgment you will begin to notice that 
 when you trust yourself 
 and follow your energy fully you feel 
 better 
 conversely when you are controlled by 
 old patterns of fear and holding back 
 you feel worse after a while 
 your form gets the message clearly and 
 begins 
 to spontaneously follow the energy 
 instead of the old pattern 
 because it knows it will feel better 
 eventually you have a form that 
 automatically goes for the most alive 
 energy in every situation 
 without having to think about it and 
 control it 
 in this process of learning to trust 
 yourself many old feelings 
 and deep emotional patterns will come to 
 the surface to be healed 
 and released this is a very important 
 part of it 
 and must be allowed to happen old 
 memories and experiences may be trig 
 scared feelings of sadness fear 
 pain guilt and rage may come up 
 allow yourself to feel all of it allow 
 it to wash through you 
 it will be released it is being cleared 
 out of your form 
 as the light of spirit penetrates every 
 cell of your body 
 it dispels the darkness as you learn to 
 consciously observe the transformation 
 process you will watch yourself 
 repeating a lot of old patterns long 
 after you seemingly know better 
 spiritually and intellectually 
 you realize there is another way but 
 emotionally 
 you are still clinging to the old habits 
 this is a difficult time try to be 
 patient and 
 compassionate with yourself when you 
 recognize the futility of 
 an old pattern so clearly it's about to 
 change 
 a short time later you will suddenly 
 begin to respond differently 
 in a more positive way as you do the 
 work of integrating spirit and form you 
 may 
 see your physical body change and become 
 lighter stronger 
 more clearly defined healthier 
 and more beautiful because your life is 
 your creation and the mirror of your 
 transformation all the 
 forms in your life your work money car 
 house relationships community 
 the world will increasingly express the 
 power and 
 beauty of your spirit meditation 
 get comfortable relax and close your 
 eyes 
 take a few deep breaths and relax your 
 body and mind completely 
 allow your con this awareness to move 
 into a deep 
 quiet place within you imagine that 
 there is a beautiful golden light 
 radiating from a 
 place deep within you it begins to grow 
 and expand until it fills 
 your entire body it's very powerful and 
 as it fills you 
 it penetrates into every cell of your 
 body 
 literally waking up each molecule to the 
 light 
 imagine your entire body glowing and 
 radiating with this 
 light then see and feel your body being 
 transformed 
 become eating healthier stronger 
 and more beautiful imagine everything 
 else 
 in your life being similarly transformed 
 exercise see if you can observe yourself 
 non-judgmentally and notice 
 when you are able to listen to your 
 intuitive feelings and act on 
 them and when you are not observe how 
 you feel and what happens in each of 
 these situations 
 ask your higher power to help you learn 
 to trust and follow your energy more and

 iac of us has male and female energies 
 within us 
 i believe that one of the most important 
 challenges we have in this world is to 
 develop these energies fully so they can 
 interact in harmony with 
 each other the eastern philosophies have 
 always 
 included the concept of ian feminine 
 slash receptive 
 and yang masculine slash active and have 
 said that everything in the universe is 
 made up of these two forces 
 in the west carl jung did pioneering and 
 exciting work with his 
 concept of the anima and the animus he 
 explained that men have 
 a feminine side anima and women have a 
 masculine side 
 animus that most of us have strongly 
 repressed these aspects of 
 our 86 selves 
 and that we must learn to come to terms 
 with them he 
 and his followers have done wonderful 
 work using dreams 
 myths and symbols to help men and women 
 reclaim the lost 
 denied parts of themselves many other 
 philosophers 
 psychologists poets play 
 rights and artists have expressed the 
 ideas of masculine 
 infamous in nine energies within 
 ourselves and within everything 
 as i mentioned in the introduction the 
 person who helped me 
 the most to understand the male and 
 female within wish early 
 lutheman her ideas in this area were so 
 clear 
 simple and pro found they literally 
 began to revolutionize my life 
 i found that this concept provided me 
 with a powerful tool 
 i could look at just about anything in 
 my life 
 or in the world from the perspective of 
 male female energies and understand what 
 was really going on so 
 much better i began to adapt and 
 reinterpret the ideas i learned 
 from eastern philosophy young and 
 lutheran in my own way and 
 incorporate them into my own metaphor i 
 have found that were 
 ever i go when i start to share this 
 metaphor with people 
 they really light up they have the same 
 reaction i did 
 it makes so many things so clear 
 some people have resistance to the words 
 female and male 
 because in our culture we have so many 
 preconceived ideas about 
 what those words mean so much emotional 
 charge associated 
 with them if it's more comfortable for 
 you 
 substitute the words yin and yang active 
 and receptive 
 dynamic and magnetic or any other words 
 that appeal to you 
 male and female i think of our female 
 aspect as our intuitive self 
 this is the deepest wisest part of 
 ourselves 
 this is the feminine energy for men or 
 women 
 it is the receptive aspect the open door 
 through 
 which the higher intelligence of the 
 universe can flow the receive 
 end of the channel our female 
 communicates to us through 
 our intuition those inner promptings gut 
 feelings 
 or images that come from a deep place 
 within us 
 if we don't pay conscious attention to 
 her in our waking life 
 she attempts to reach us through our 
 dreams 
 our emotions and our physical body she 
 is 
 the source of higher wisdom within us 
 and if we learn to listen 
 carefully to her moment by moment she 
 will guide us perfectly 
 the male aspect is action our ability to 
 do things in the 
 physical world to think to speak to move 
 our bodies 
 again whether you are a man or a woman 
 your masculine energy is your 
 ability to act it is the outflowing end 
 of the channel 
 the femi nine receives the universal 
 creative energy and the masculine 
 expresses it in the world through action 
 thus 
 we have the cr out of process our female 
 is inspired by a creative impulse and 
 communicates 
 it to us through a feeling and our mail 
 acts on it by speaking 
 mouth or doing whatever is appropriate 
 for example an artist might awaken with 
 an inspired idea for 
 a painting an image communicated from 
 his female 
 and a meaty italy go into his studio 
 pick up his brush and begin painting 
 action taken by his male a mother might 
 feel sudden concern for her child 
 a warning from her inner female and run 
 into the other room and pull the child 
 away from a hot stove 
 action taken by her mail a business 
 person might have an impulse to contact 
 a certain 
 associate guidance from his or her 
 female make a call 
 action taken by his or her mail and put 
 together a new deal 
 in each case where the male and female 
 within were in creative 
 union there was a creative result a 
 painting 
 saving the child a business enterprise 
 even the simple sequence of feeling 
 hungry 
 going to the kitchen and fixing a meal 
 illustrates the same process 
 the union of feminine and masculine 
 energies within the indie 
 visual is the basis of all creation our 
 female intuition 
 plus our male action equals creativity 
 in order to live a harmonious and 
 creative life you need to have 
 both your inner female and male energies 
 fully developed and funk 
 chinning correctly together to fully 
 integrate the inner male and 
 female you need to put the female in the 
 guiding position 
 this is her natural function she is your 
 intuition 
 the door to your high her intelligence 
 your male listens to her and acts on her 
 feelings the true 
 function of male energy is absolute 
 clarity directness 
 and a paw set it strength based on what 
 the universe inside of you 
 coming through your female tells you 
 the female says i feel this he says 
 i hear your feelings what would you like 
 me to do 
 she says i want that he says 
 you want that okay great i'll get it for 
 you 
 and he goes direct lie to get it for her 
 trusting that in her desire is the 
 wisdom of the 
 universe remember now that i am talking 
 about an internal process in 
 each of us sometimes people externalize 
 this idea and think i'm 
 saying that men should let women tell 
 them what to do 
 what i'm actually saying is that we each 
 need to let our intuition guide us 
 and then be willing to follow that 
 guidance directly and fearlessly 
 the nature of the feminine is wisdom 
 love and clear vision 
 expressed through feeling and desire the 
 male nature is all out 
 risk taking action in service to the 
 feminine much like the chival 
 rouse knight and his lady through his 
 surrender to her and his action on her 
 behalf 
 our male energy builds a personality 
 structure within us that protects 
 and honors the sensitive energy of our 
 intuitive female 
 i often imagine my male is standing 
 behind my female 
 supporting protecting and backing her up 
 for a man the image might be reversed 
 you might see your female as within or 
 behind you 
 guiding empowering nurturing and 
 supporting you 
 when these two energies are thus in 
 harmony and working together 
 it's an incredible feeling a strong 
 open creative channel with power 
 wisdom peace and love flowing through 
 the old male and the old female 
 unfortunately 
 most of us have not yet learned how to 
 allow our male and female energies to 
 function naturally 
 in the proper relationship with each 
 other 
 in our patriarchal culture we have used 
 our male energy 
 our ability to think and act to suppress 
 and control our feminine 
 intuition rather than to support and 
 express her 
 i call this dirty functional use of the 
 male energy the old male 
 and it exists equally in men and women 
 although it is often more obvious and 
 external 
 in men more subtle and internal in women 
 the old male is that part of us that 
 wants to keep control 
 he is terrified of our feminine power 
 because he doesn't want to soar 
 render to the power of the universe he 
 is afraid that if he surren 
 durs he will lose his individual 
 identity 
 he holds on to individuality and 
 separateness at any 
 cost therefore he denies the 
 power of the feminine which is a force 
 moving toward union and 
 oneness in relationship with the old 
 male 
 the female is helpless in the world 
 her power cannot move directly into the 
 physical world 
 without the support of the male's action 
 her power is suppressed 
 and must come out indirectly through 
 manipulative patterns or 
 physical illnesses or in sudden 
 unfocused ways 
 such as emo functional outbursts 
 you can see that men and women have 
 played out these roles 
 externally in the traditional male role 
 men are taught to deny and 
 suppress their inner female to be 
 machine-like 
 unemotional total lie in control 
 and suppressive toward women secretly 
 they may be 
 terrified of women because women remind 
 them of the power of 
 their inner feminine side which they are 
 busy denying 
 because sidra stone has written a 
 fascinating book exploring the hidden 
 patriarchal voice in 
 women called the shadow king recommended 
 resources 
 they are cut off from their internal 
 power source they really feel 
 very alone and lost in the traditional 
 female role a woman 
 also learns to use her male energy to 
 deny and suppress her feminine 
 power this leaves her helpless 
 dependent on men and able to express her 
 power only 
 indirectly through manipulation she may 
 be afraid that if men 
 found out how powerful she is they would 
 abandon her 
 so she carefully keeps her power hidden 
 perhaps even from herself it's important 
 to realize that both the old male and 
 the old 
 female exist in each sex a woman who is 
 expressing 
 herself in the traditional way described 
 above has a controlling 
 macho old male inside her suppressing 
 her 
 she will tend to attract men who mirror 
 her this male personality and will act 
 it out in their behavior toward 
 her this behavior may range from 
 paternalistic 
 and chauvinistic to verbally and 
 physically abusive 
 depending on how the woman treats 
 herself and what she believes she 
 deserves 
 once she begins to trust and love 
 herself 
 more and starts to use her internal male 
 energy to support herself 
 the behavior of the men in her life will 
 reflect that shift 
 they will either change dramatically and 
 can't uh to change as she does 
 or they will disappear from her life to 
 be 
 replaced by men who are supportive and 
 appreciative of her 
 who will mirror her new attitude toward 
 herself 
 i've seen this happen many times 
 the traditional macho man has a helpless 
 female voice inside 
 of him desperately trying to be heard he 
 will tend to attract 
 women who have a low self-image and are 
 clingy and needy or who 
 express their power indirectly through 
 manipulation 
 little girl cuteness sexual 
 seductiveness 
 cattiness or dishonesty these 
 women reflect his lack of trust and 
 respect for his inner female by 
 not trusting and respecting themselves 
 by opening to 
 and trust in his own feminine nature 
 he'll find within himself the nurture in 
 support and connection he's been lacking 
 the women in his 
 life will mirror this shift by becoming 
 stronger more independent 
 more direct and honest and more 
 genuinely loving and nurturing 
 the new male and the new female the 
 feminine power 
 the power of the spirit is always within 
 us it is up to our male energy to 
 determine how we relate to that 
 power we can either fight it block it 
 attempt to control it 
 and try to keep ourselves separate from 
 it 
 or we can surrender and open to it learn 
 to support it 
 and move with it individually and 
 collectively 
 we are shifting from a position of fear 
 and control 
 into surrender and trust of the 
 intuitive the 
 power of the feminine energy is on the 
 rise in our world 
 as she emerges within us and we 
 acknowledge and surrender to her 
 the old male within us is transformed 
 he re-emerges birthed through the female 
 as the new male the one who goes all out 
 in his trust 
 and love for her he must grow to become 
 her equal empower so 
 that they can be the partners they are 
 meant to be i believe that the new male 
 has been truly birthed in our khan 
 cisness only within the last few years 
 before that 
 we had little experience in our bodies 
 of the true male energy 
 our only con captive male was the old 
 patriarchal male 
 an energy divorced from the feminine 
 the birth of the new male is synonymous 
 with the birth of 
 the new age the new world is being built 
 within us and mirrored 
 around us as the new male physical form 
 emerges in all his glory 
 from the feminine power spirit an image 
 every now and then i do a visualization 
 process in which i ask 
 for an image of my male and female each 
 time i do it 
 i receive something a little different 
 that teaches me something new 
 i'm sharing with you one of the most 
 powerful images 
 because it is such a dramatic 
 illustration of one aspect of the 
 relationship 
 between inner female and male my female 
 energy appeared as a beautiful 
 radiant queen over flowing with love and 
 light 
 she was being carried through the 
 streets on a litter borne by several 
 carriers 
 the people were lining the streets 
 waiting for an opportunity to see her 
 she was sober title open 
 and loving that as she passed by waving 
 smiling 
 and throwing kisses to people they were 
 instantly healed of any pain 
 or limitation by her side walked a 
 samurai warrior carrying a sword 
 this was my male energy it was well 
 understood by everyone that if 
 anyone made a threatening move toward 
 the queen he would 
 instantly raise his sword and ruthlessly 
 cut down the offender 
 knowing this naturally no one dared to 
 harm her 
 he was willing to be absolutely 
 unhesitating in his trust of his 
 own judgment and his own response which 
 left her completely safe 
 and protected feeling totally safe 
 having no need to hide or 
 defend herself she was free to be 
 completely open 
 soft and loving and to give her gifts 
 freely and generously to all around her 
 meditation sit or lie down in a 
 comfortable position and close your eyes 
 take a few deep breaths and relax your 
 body and mind complete 
 lie allow your conscious awareness to 
 move into a quiet 
 place with in you now bring to your mind 
 an image that represents your inner 
 female this image could be an actual 
 person 
 an animal or it could be something more 
 abstract 
 an energy a color or shape or simply a 
 feeling 
 spontaneously take whatever comes to you 
 take a look at your female and get a 
 sense or a feeling of what 
 she represents to you notice some of the 
 details of the image 
 notice the colors and textures notice 
 how you feel about her 
 ask her if she has anything she would 
 like to say to you right 
 now allow yourself to receive her 
 communication 
 which may or may not be in words 
 you may also ask her any questions you 
 have 
 there may be something you want to know 
 from her again 
 receive her communication to you whether 
 it comes in words 
 a feeling or an image 
 once you have allowed yourself to 
 receive her communication 
 and you feel complete for this moment 
 take a deep breath and 
 release her image from your mind come 
 back to a quiet 
 still place now draw to mind an image 
 that represents your male self 
 again take what image comes to you it 
 could be an image of an 
 actual man or it could be some abstract 
 symbol or color 
 explore this image begin to notice the 
 details of it 
 notice its colors and texture 
 notice how you feel about him then ask 
 him if he has 
 anything to communicate to you at this 
 time be receptive to 
 receiving his communication whether it 
 is in words or some other 
 form if you have anything you want to 
 ask him 
 do this now b open to any words or 
 images you may receive 
 if an answer doesn't come to you 
 immediately 
 know that it will come later once you 
 feel complete with your communication 
 with him 
 release his image from your mind come 
 again to a quiet place inside 
 now ask for the images of both your male 
 and female to come 
 to you at the same time see how they 
 relate to one another 
 are they in relationship to one another 
 or are they separate 
 if they are in relationship to one 
 another 
 how do they relate ask them if they have 
 anything they would like to communicate 
 to one enough 
 r to you stay open to what comes to you 
 in words images or feelings 
 if you have anything you'd like to say 
 to them or ask them 
 do that now when you feel complete 
 once again take a deep breath and 
 release their images from your mind 
 come back to a quiet still place inside 
 exercise close your eyes and contact 
 your female intuitive voice 
 ask her what she wants is there a gift 
 she desires or something 
 she wants to say or do when she has told 
 you what she wants 
 emac on your new male supporting her 
 desire 
 see him taking whatever necessary action 
 to honor her need and desire when you 
 open your eyes 
 do your best to follow whatever you feel 
 your intuition wants you to do 
 chapter nine men and women 
 we all instinctively understand the 
 basic functions of feminine 
 and masculine energies but we may not 
 realize that they both exist 
 in each person more often we tend to 
 associate male and female 
 energies with their respective body 
 types 
 thus women have become the symbols of 
 female energy 
 traditionally women have developed and 
 expressed receptivity 
 nurturing intuition sensitivity and 
 emotion 
 in the past many women more or less 
 repressed assertiveness 
 direct action intellect and the ability 
 to function effectively and strongly in 
 the world 
 likewise men have become the symbols of 
 male energy 
 traditionally they have developed their 
 ability to act in the world 
 98 strongly directly 
 assertively and aggressively many men 
 repressed 
 and denied their intuition emotional 
 feelings sensitivity 
 and nurturing as we cannot live in the 
 world without the full range of mass 
 cooling and feminine energies each sex 
 has been helplessly dipped 
 dimmed on the other half for its 
 survival from this perspective 
 each person is only half a person 
 dependent on their other half for its 
 very existence 
 men have desperately needed women to 
 provide them with the nurturing 
 intuitive wisdom and emotional support 
 without which they unconsciously know 
 they would die women 
 have been dependent on men to take care 
 of them and provide for 
 them in the physical world where they 
 haven't known how to take 
 care of themselves it might seem like a 
 perfectly workable arrangement 
 men help women women help men 
 except for one underlying prob lem 
 as an individual if you don't feel whole 
 if you feel you're sore 
 fievel depends on another person you are 
 constantly afraid of 
 losing them what if that person dies or 
 goes away 
 then you die two unless you can find 
 another such person who is willing to 
 take 
 care of you of course something might 
 happen to that person 
 also thus life becomes a constant state 
 of fear in which the other 
 person is merely an object for you your 
 supply of love or pro 
 protection you must control that source 
 at any cost 
 either directly by force or superior 
 strength 
 or indirectly using various 
 manipulations 
 generally this happens subtly i'll give 
 you what you 
 need so you will be just as dependent on 
 me as i am on you 
 so you will keep giving me what i need 
 so our relationships have been based on 
 dependency and the 
 need to control the other person 
 inevitably 
 this leads to resent mint and anger 
 most of which we repress because it 
 would be too 
 dangerous to express it and risk losing 
 the other person 
 the repressing of all these feelings 
 leads to dullness and deadness 
 this is one reason why so many 
 relationships start off exciting 
 wow i think i've found someone who can 
 really fulfill my needs 
 and end up either filled with anger or 
 relatively dull and boring 
 they aren't fulfilling my needs nearly 
 as well as i had hoped 
 and i've lost my own identity in the 
 process 
 but i'm afraid to let go for fear i'll 
 die without this person 
 finding the balance in recent times 
 of course the strongly separated roles 
 of men 
 and women have begun to shift in the 
 last two generations 
 increasing numbers of women are 
 exploring and expressing their 
 abilities to act in the world at the 
 same time 
 a growing number of men have been 
 looking within themselves and learning 
 to open 
 to their feelings and intuition i 
 believe this 
 is happening because we have reached a 
 dead end street with our old world 
 relationships and externalized con 
 caps of masculine and feminine the old 
 models and ways of 
 doing things are too limiting for us now 
 and we have not yet 
 evolved effective patterns to take their 
 place it's a period of chaos 
 and confusion pain and insecurity but 
 also of tremendous 
 growth we are making a leap into the new 
 world 
 i believe that every form of 
 relationship 
 from the most traditional marriage to 
 homosexual or bisexual relationships 
 represents each person's attempt to find 
 their feminine 
 masculine balance within women have 
 traditionally been in touch with their 
 female 
 energy but they haven't backed her up 
 with their male energy 
 they have not acknowledged what they 
 know inside 
 they have always acted as if they were 
 powerless when they are really very 
 powerful 
 they have gone after external validation 
 from men especially 
 rather than internally validating 
 themselves for what they know 
 and who they are many women like myself 
 have had strongly developed male energy 
 but have used it in the old male way 
 i was very intellect to all very active 
 and drove myself very hard to shoulder 
 the 
 responsibilities of the world i also had 
 a very strongly developed 
 female but i didn't put her in charge in 
 fact 
 i ignored her a lot of the time i 
 basically protected my sensitive 
 vulnerable feelings by 
 directing a tough outer shell i've had 
 to learn to take that powerful male 
 energy and use it 
 to listen to trust and support my female 
 this allows her the safe tie and support 
 to emerge fully 
 i feel and appear softer more receptive 
 and more vulnerable but i am really much 
 stronger than 
 before women are now learning to back 
 themselves up and validate 
 themselves instead of abandoning the 
 responsibility and 
 trying to get a man to do it for them 
 however it's a deceited pattern that has 
 endured for centuries 
 and it takes time to change it in the 
 deepest layers 
 the key is to just keep listening to 
 trusting 
 and acting on our deepest feelings 
 the qualities that women have looked for 
 in men strength 
 power responsibility caring excitement 
 romance must be developed inside of 
 ourselves 
 a simple formula is this just treat 
 yourself exactly the way you would want 
 to be treated by a man 
 the interesting thing is that what we 
 create within us is always 
 mirrored outside of us this is the law 
 of the universe 
 when you have built an inner male who 
 supports and loves you 
 there will always be a man or even many 
 men 
 in your life who will reflect this 
 when you truly give up trying to get 
 something outside your 
 self you end up having what you always 
 wanted 
 for men of course the principle is 
 exactly the same 
 men are traditionally disconnected from 
 their female energy 
 thereby dis connected from life power 
 and love they've been out there in the 
 world secretly feeling helpless alone 
 and empty 
 although they pretend to be in control 
 and powerful 
 war is a good example of the old male 
 energy lacking the wisdom and direction 
 of the 
 men seek nurturing and internal 
 connection through 
 women but once they have connected with 
 their own inner female 
 they will receive her incredible love 
 from within themselves 
 for men all the qualities you've wanted 
 from a woman 
 the nurturing softness warmth 
 strength sexuality and beauty 
 already exist in your inner female you 
 will feel this when you learn 
 to listen to your inner feelings and 
 support them you need to 
 totally respect and honor your inner 
 female energy by acting on 
 your feelings for her then every woman 
 every person in your life will mirror 
 that integration 
 they will have the qualities you've 
 always wanted 
 and they will also receive love warmth 
 knower 
 touring and strength from you many men 
 especially in recent times have chosen 
 to connect 
 deeply with their feminine energy and in 
 doing so 
 have discon connected from their mail 
 they've rejected the old macho image and 
 have no other concept of male energy to 
 relate to 
 these men are usually so afraid of their 
 male 
 energy fearing that it will burst forth 
 with all the old mindlessness and 
 violence they equate with male 
 ness that they reject the positive 
 assertive male qualities as well 
 i feel it's very important for these men 
 to embrace the concept 
 of the new male one who allows his 
 spontaneous 
 active edgars submale energy to flow 
 freely 
 knowing that the power of his feminine 
 is in charge 
 wisely directing him this requires a 
 deep 
 trust that the inner female knows what 
 she's doing and won't allow 
 anything destructive or harmful to 
 happen new world relationships 
 a new idea of relationships is emerging 
 that is based on each 
 person developing wholeness within him 
 or herself 
 internally each person is moving toward 
 becoming a fully balanced femi 
 9 masculine being with a wide range of 
 expression 
 from soft a state receptivity to 
 strongest action 
 externally most people's style of 
 expression will certainly be 
 determined strongly by which type of 
 body they are in 
 male or female when people hear these 
 ideas they sometimes express the fear 
 that we will all become outwardly 
 androgynous men and 
 women all appearing pretty much the same 
 the reverse is actually 
 true the more women develop and trust 
 their male aspect to sup 
 port them and back them up internally 
 the safer they feel to allow 
 their soft receptive beautiful feminine 
 aspect to open up 
 the women i know who are going through 
 this process 
 myself include ed seem to become more 
 feminine and beautiful even while they 
 are strengthening their masculine 
 qualities men who are surren 
 deering and opening fully to their 
 female energy are actually recon 
 nectar with the inner feminine power 
 which enhances and 
 strengthens their masculine qualities 
 far from becoming a feminine 
 nate the men i know who are involved in 
 this process become 
 more secure in their maleness in the new 
 world 
 when a man is attracted to a woman he 
 wreck 
 organizes her as a mirror of his 
 feminine aspect 
 through her reflection he can learn more 
 about his own female side and move 
 through 
 whatever fears and barriers he may have 
 to come to a deeper entity 
 gration within himself when a woman 
 falls in love with a man 
 she is seeing her own male reflected in 
 him 
 in her interactions with him she can 
 learn to strengthen and trust her 
 masculine side 
 if you know on a deep level that the 
 person you're attracted to 
 is a mirror of yourself you cannot be 
 overly dependent on him or 
 her because you know that everything you 
 see in your partner is 
 also in you you recognize that one of 
 the main reasons you're in 
 the relationship is to learn about 
 yourself and deepen your con 
 connection with the universe so healthy 
 relationships are based on 
 the passion and excitement of sharing 
 the journey into becoming 
 a whole person this might sound like we 
 are evolving to a place where we are 
 so whole within ourselves that we no 
 longer need relationships at 
 all the paradox is this as human beings 
 we are social entered pendant creatures 
 we do need one another part of 
 experiencing 
 wholeness is accepting the parts of us 
 that need love closeness 
 and intimacy with one another so 
 creating conscious relationships 
 involves honoring both our dependents 
 and our interdependence 
 gay relationships my own experience in 
 relationships is heterosexual 
 so i can hardly consider myself much of 
 an expert on gay relationships 
 however from talking and working with 
 quite a few gay and lay 
 by and friends and clients i do have a 
 strong sense that on a spiritu 
 a level homosexual and bisexual 
 relationships are a powerful step 
 that some beings take to break through 
 old rigid roles and stereo 
 types to find their own truth for some 
 people 
 being in a close intense relationship 
 with a 
 person or persons of the same sex is the 
 most powerful mirroring 
 process they can find two women for 
 example 
 often seem to find a depth of connection 
 with each other that they don't find 
 with a 
 man they use this intuitive feminine 
 connection to create a strong 
 foundation and safe environment for each 
 of them to practice 
 building their internal mail they 
 totally reflect and support each 
 other in becoming whole and balanced a 
 man sometimes seems to find a matching 
 male intensity with 
 another man an ability to go all out 
 that he wouldn't find with 
 a woman he may also find in another man 
 of support for moving 
 into and exploring his feminine self 
 without feeling he has to full 
 fill the old stereotyped male role 
 i think many of these things are 
 mysteries that we will under 
 stand only in retrospect i believe that 
 every being chooses the life 
 path in relationships that will help him 
 or her to grow the fastest 
 as we continue to evolve i believe we 
 will gradually stop gate 
 gorizing ourselves and our relationships 
 with any particular labels 
 such as gay straight and so on i foresee 
 a time when each person 
 can be a unique entity with his or her 
 free-flowing style of experts 
 cyan each relationship will be a unique 
 connection between two 
 beings taking its individual form and 
 expression 
 no categories are possible because each 
 one is so different and follows its own 
 flow 
 of energy exercise think of some of the 
 most important women in your life 
 what are their strongest or most 
 attractive qualities 
 be aware that they mirror some aspects 
 of your own female energy 
 whether you are a woman or a man 
 now think of some of the most important 
 men in your life 
 what qualities do you most like admire 
 or appreciate about them 
 recognize that they reflect similar 
 aspects of your own male inner 
 gee again this applies to you whether 
 you're a man or a woman 
 if you have trouble seeing that some of 
 the things you admire 
 and others are in you as well it may be 
 because you have not yet 
 developed those qualities in yourself as 
 strongly as they have 
 in this case try the following 
 meditation 
 meditation get in a comfortable position 
 close your eyes relax take a 
 few deep slow breaths and move your 
 consciousness into a deep 
 quiet place inside bring to mind one 
 person whom you admire are attracted 
 2. ask yourself what qualities you find 
 most attractive in whisper 
 son do you see those same qualities in 
 yourself 
 if not try my inning that you possess 
 those same qualities 
 imagine how you would look talk and 
 act picture yourself in a variety of 
 situations 
 and interactions if you feel these are 
 qualities you want to further develop 
 with 
 in yourself continue to do this 
 visualization regularly for a while 
 chapter 10 east and west a new 
 challenge i have a strong feeling that 
 in my last life i was a spiritual 
 aesthetic 
 perhaps in india and probably living in 
 meditation on a mound 
 tame top somewhere that way of life has 
 a comfortable familiarity 
 to it and there is a longing somewhere 
 within me to continue to 
 live in that blissful simplicity however 
 i know that this time i 
 have chosen to take it to the next level 
 to integrate the spirit 
 to al mental emotional 
 and physical aspects of my being and 
 learn 
 to live and balance in the world it is 
 interesting to look at the world from 
 the perspective of 
 male and female or spirit and form in 
 doing so i have disc of 
 it some fascinating things in a sense 
 the east can be seen to 108 
 represent the feminine polarity many of 
 the eastern cultures have 
 an ancient and powerful spiritual 
 tradition until recently 
 their strength and development have been 
 primarily in the intuitive and 
 spiritual realms at least in comparison 
 with the western world 
 they have lacked development in the 
 physical realm and as a 
 result they have experienced a great 
 deal of poverty 
 chaos and confusion 
 the energy in the west europe and the 
 united states 
 is more masculine in modern history it 
 has focused primarily on 
 developing the physical realm while 
 paying little attention to spur 
 tool development as a result we have 
 made incredible techno 
 logical progress but we are experiencing 
 a terrible poverty of spirit 
 a feeling of disconnection from our 
 source 
 these two worlds are drawn to one 
 another just as men and 
 women are with a certain amount of fear 
 and distrust 
 but in overwhelming attraction 
 nonetheless 
 eastern spiritual teachings are flooding 
 the west 
 and western technology is gravitating 
 toward the east we are each hungry for 
 what the other 
 has one of my favorite mental pictures 
 of my travels in india is 
 this i was standing in a bazaar in front 
 of me were two booths 
 one booth had beautiful traditional 
 handcrafted items for sale 
 a group of europeans and americans were 
 crowded around it 
 eager lie bargaining for the lovely 
 treasures 
 the other booth proudly dis played a 
 variety of plastic items 
 bowls kitchen utensils even plastic 
 shoes 
 a long line of indians patiently waited 
 their turn to 
 purchase these precious things naturally 
 neither one of the 
 groups cast even a second glance at the 
 other booth 
 east and west can learn from each other 
 but like women and 
 men they must ultimately find within 
 themselves that which they 
 admire in each other hopefully the 
 developing third world 
 countries will learn from our mistakes 
 and develop a technology 
 that is more harmoniously attuned to the 
 spirit and the environ 
 meant and we in the west must develop a 
 spiritual path that helps 
 us to deal with the physical world the 
 eastern spiritual traditions 
 and our western spiritual tray additions 
 as well for that matter are based on 
 removing oneself as 
 much as possible from the world in order 
 to connect more deeply 
 with the spirit the world with its 
 temptations and distractions 
 is a very difficult place to maintain a 
 focus on 
 and commitment 2. inner truth 
 thus most serious traditional spiritual 
 paths have involved 
 some degree of renunciation of the world 
 relationships 
 money material possessions pleasures 
 and luxuries have been given up the 
 ideal has been to withdraw to a 
 monastery or mountaintop hand 
 pursue a life of quiet contemplation 
 giving up all attachment to the 
 world even those who choose to remain 
 householders with femi 
 lies and jobs have usually followed 
 strong rules and restrictions that 
 are designed to keep them as separate 
 from the world as possible 
 this contemplative spiritual orientation 
 has been a necessary 
 and powerful step but it is reflective 
 of the split we have main 
 tained between spirit and form between 
 the female and male with 
 in us to be a spiritual seeker we have 
 had to leave the physical 
 world enlightenment has been the reason 
 for reclaiming 
 spirit by denying the body transcending 
 form by leaving it 
 thus individual beings have become 
 enlightened in the sense that they 
 have fully realized their spiritual 
 nature but they have not fully 
 integrated that enlightenment into their 
 form 
 when they have eventually left their 
 bodies 
 the world remains largely entranced 
 formed 
 these masters have supported and 
 preserved the intuitive 
 principle in our world and have paved 
 the way for us to take the 
 next step the integration of feminine 
 and masculine 
 spirit and form and the subsequent 
 transformation of our world 
 those of us who choose to be spiritual 
 seekers and trans 
 formers must now move into the world 
 with the same degree of calm 
 commitment to our spiritual selves as we 
 would have if we renounced 
 the world this path is much more 
 difficult 
 we are now chill lunge to surrender to 
 the universe 
 to follow its guidance and to do so 
 while having deep 
 passionate relationships dealing with 
 money business family creative projects 
 and so many other worldly things 
 rather than avoiding our attachments to 
 the world 
 the time has come to acknowledge and 
 work with them 
 we must move into the challenging 
 situation 
 move into recognize and on 
 all the feelings and attachment and 
 learn to embrace the full 
 range of our experience meditation 
 relax close your eyes and take a few 
 deep breaths 
 with each breath drop more deeply into a 
 quiet place inside yourself 
 from this place of calm start to see a 
 new image of yourself 
 in the world your focus is on the 
 universe and you follow its guidance 
 you trust yourself you feel strong and 
 courageous 
 you carry a sense of knowing this with 
 you into the world 
 because of this trust and focus within 
 yourself 
 what you create on the outside is 
 beautiful 
 your world is nourishing to you and 
 others you are have 
 in deep passionate relationships and are 
 dealing with people 
 money your career your body and 
 everything else around you 
 you are able to be in the world and 
 enjoy all worldly things 
 yet keep your commitment to the universe 
 within yourself 
 this calm commitment is reflected in the 
 light and power you feel 
 part 2 living the principles 
 chapter 11 trusting intuition 
 and most of us have been taught from 
 childhood not to trust 
 our feelings not to express ourselves 
 truthfully 
 and honestly not to recognize that at 
 the core of our being lies a loving 
 powerful and creative nature 
 we learn easily to try to accommodate 
 those 
 around us to follow certain rules of 
 behavior to suppress our 
 spontaneous impulses and to do what is 
 expected of us 
 even if we rebel against this we are 
 trapped in our rebellion 
 doing the opposite of what we've been 
 told in a knee-jerk reaction against 
 authority very seldom do we receive any 
 support for trusting our 
 selves listening to our own sense of 
 inner truth and 
 expressing ourselves in a direct and 
 honest way 
 115 when we consistently suppress and 
 distrust our intuitive 
 knowingness looking instead for 
 authority validation 
 and approval from others we give our 
 personal power 
 away this leads to feelings of 
 helplessness 
 emptiness a sense of being a victim and 
 eventually to anger and rage 
 and if these feelings are also 
 suppressed 
 to depression and deadness we may simply 
 succumb 
 to these feelings and lead a life of 
 quiet numbness 
 we may over compensate for our feelings 
 of powerlessness by attempting to 
 control and manipulate other people and 
 our environment 
 or we may eventually burst forth with 
 uncontrolled rage that is highly 
 exaggerated and distorted by its long 
 suppression 
 none of these are very positive 
 alternatives 
 the true solution is to re-educate 
 ourselves to listen to and 
 trust the inner truths that come to us 
 through our intuitive feel 
 inks following our inner guidance may 
 feel risky and frightening 
 at first because we are no longer 
 playing it safe 
 doing what we should do pleasing others 
 following the rules or deferring to out 
 side authority to live this way is to 
 risk losing everything that we 
 have held onto for reasons of external 
 false 
 security but we will gain integrity 
 wholeness true power creativity and the 
 real saku 
 ready of knowing that we are in 
 alignment with the power of the 
 universe in suggesting that our 
 intuition needs to be the guiding force 
 in our lives i am not attempting to 
 disregard or eliminate the 
 rational mind the intellect is a very 
 powerful tool 
 best used to support and give expression 
 to our intuitive wisdom 
 rather than as we often use it to 
 suppress our intuition 
 most of us have programmed our intellect 
 to doubt our intuition 
 when and into a tiff feeling arises 
 our rational minds immediately say i 
 don't 
 think that will work nobody else is 
 doing it that way 
 or what a foolish idea and the intuition 
 is disregarded 
 as we move into the new world it is time 
 to re-educate our 
 intellect to recognize the intuition as 
 a valid source of information 
 and guidance we must train our intellect 
 to listen to and express 
 the intuitive voice the intellect is by 
 nature very disciplined and 
 this discipline can help us to ask for 
 and receive the direction of 
 the intuitive self what does it mean to 
 trust your intuition 
 how do you do it it means tuning into 
 your gut feelings 
 your deepest tenor sense of personal 
 truth 
 in any given situation and acting on 
 these feelings moment by moment 
 sometimes 
 these guts sages may tell you to do 
 something unexpected or inconsistent 
 with your previous plans they may 
 require that you trust a hunch 
 that seems illogical you may feel more 
 emotionally vulnerable than 
 you are used to feeling you may express 
 thoughts 
 feelings or opinions foreign to your 
 usual beliefs 
 you may follow a dream or fantasy 
 or take some degree of financial risk to 
 do something that 
 feels important to you at first you may 
 fear that trusting your intuition will 
 lead you 
 to do things that seem somewhat hurtful 
 or irresponsible to oath 
 errs for example you may hesitate to 
 break a date 
 even though you need time for yourself 
 because you fear hurting your dates feel 
 inks 
 i've found that when i really listen to 
 and trust my inner voice 
 in the long run everyone around me 
 benefits as much as i do 
 people may sometimes be temporarily 
 disappointed irritated 
 or a bit shaken up as you change your 
 old patterns of relating to 
 yourself and others but this is usually 
 because as you change 
 the people around you are automatically 
 pushed to change as well 
 if you trust you will see that the 
 changes are also for their highest 
 good if you do break that date your 
 friend may 
 end up having a wonderful time doing 
 something else 
 if they don't want to change they may 
 move away from you 
 at least for a while there 4 
 you must be willing to let go of the 
 forms of relationship 
 you have with people if there is a deep 
 connection between you 
 chances are good that you will be close 
 again in the future 
 meanwhile everyone needs to grow in 
 their own way and their own 
 time as you continue to follow your path 
 you will increasingly 
 attract people who like you as you are 
 and relate to you in a way 
 that feels honest supportive and 
 appreciative 
 practicing a new way of living learning 
 to trust your intuition is an art form 
 and like all other art forms it takes 
 practice to perfect 
 you don't learn to do it overnight 
 you have to be willing to make mistakes 
 to try 
 something and fail then try something 
 different the next time 
 and sometimes perhaps even embarrass 
 yourself or feel foolish 
 your intuition is always correct but it 
 takes time to learn to hear 
 it correctly if you are willing to risk 
 acting on what you believe to 
 be true and risk making mistakes you 
 will learn very fast by pay 
 pay attention to what works and what 
 doesn't if you hold 
 back out of fear of being wrong learning 
 to trust your intuition could take 
 a lifetime it can be hard to distinguish 
 the voice of our intuition 
 from the many other selves that speak to 
 us from within 
 the different parts of ourselves that 
 have their own idea of what's 
 best for us people frequently ask me how 
 to differentiate the voice or 
 energy of intuition from all the others 
 unfortunately there's no 
 simple surefire way at first most of us 
 are in touch with our 
 intuition whether we know it or not but 
 we're actually in the habit 
 of doubting or contradicting it so 
 automatically that we don't even 
 know it has spoken the first step in 
 learning is to pay morton 
 shin to what you feel inside to the 
 inner dialogue that goes on 
 within you for example you might feel 
 i'd like to give jim a call immediately 
 a rational doubting voice inside says 
 why call him 
 at this time of day he probably won't be 
 home 
 and you auto matically ignore your 
 original 
 impulse to call if you had called 
 you might have found him at home and 
 discovered he had some 
 important information for you another 
 example 
 you might get a feeling in the middle of 
 the day that says 
 i'm tired i'd like to take a rest you 
 immediately 
 think i can't rest now i have a lot of 
 work to do 
 so you drink some coffee to get yourself 
 going and work the rest of the day 
 bye the end of the day you feel tired 
 drained and irritable whereas if 
 you had trusted your initial feeling you 
 might have rested for half 
 an hour and continued about your tasks 
 refreshed and efficient finishing your 
 day in a state of balance 
 as you become aware of this subtle inner 
 dialogue between 
 your intuition and your other inner 
 voices it's very important not 
 to put yourself down or diminish this 
 experience 
 try to remain a somewhat objective 
 observer 
 notice what happens when you follow your 
 intuitive feelings 
 the result is usually increased tenor g 
 and power and a sense of things flowing 
 now 
 notice what happens when you doubt 
 suppress 
 or act against your feelings usually 
 you will observe decreased energy you 
 may feel somewhat 
 disempowered or depressed you may even 
 experience 
 emotional or physical pain 
 whether or not you act on your intuitive 
 feelings you'll be 
 learning something so try not to condemn 
 yourself when you 
 don't follow your intuition thus adding 
 insult to injury 
 remember it takes time to learn new 
 habits the old ways 
 are deeply ingrained i've been working 
 intensively on my own re at you cation 
 for many years 
 and while the results i'm enjoying are 
 one 
 durfal there are still times when i 
 don't yet have the courage or 
 awareness to be able to trust myself 
 completely and do exactly what 
 i feel i'm learning to be patient and 
 compassionate with myself as 
 i gain the courage to be true to myself 
 suppose you are trying to decide whether 
 to change jobs 
 you might have a conservative self that 
 feels it would be safest to stay 
 where you are an adventurous self that 
 is eager to do something 
 different a self that is concerned about 
 what other people 
 will think and so on one way to handle 
 this is to listen to each of 
 these voices and write down what each 
 has to say perhaps using a 
 different color pin for each one then 
 just let yourself sit with 
 all the conflicting viewpoints for a 
 while without trying to resolve 
 them or make a decision eventually you 
 will start to get an into 
 active sense of what your next step 
 needs to be 
 as you get to know the different selves 
 within you you will 
 discover that your intuitive self has an 
 energy or a feeling that is 
 different from the other voices in time 
 you will learn to recognize 
 it quite easily one important step in 
 learning to hear and follow you're into 
 action is simply to practice checking in 
 regularly 
 at least twice a day and much more often 
 if possible once an hour is great take 
 a moment or two or longer if you can 
 to relax and listen to your gut feelings 
 cultivate this habit of talking to your 
 intuitive self 
 ask for help and guidance when you need 
 it and practice listening 
 for answers that may come in many forms 
 words 
 images feelings or even through being 
 led to some external source such as a 
 book 
 a friend or a teacher who will tell you 
 just what you need to know 
 your body is a tremendous helper in 
 learning to follow your in or 
 voice whenever you feel your body is in 
 pain or discomfort 
 it is usually an indication that you 
 have ignored your feelings 
 use it as a signal to tune in and ask 
 what you need to be aware of 
 as you learn to live from your intuition 
 you give up making 
 decisions with your head you act moment 
 by moment 
 on what you feel and allow things to 
 unfold as you go 
 in this way you are led in the direction 
 that is right for you 
 and decisions are made easily and 
 naturally 
 if possible try not to make big 
 decisions 
 concerning future events until you are 
 clear about what you want 
 focus on following the energy in the 
 moment and you'll find that 
 it will all be handled in its own time 
 and way when you must 
 make a decision related to something in 
 the future follow your gut 
 feeling about it at the time the 
 decision needs to be made 
 remember too that although i sometimes 
 speak a following 
 your inner intuitive voice most people 
 do not literally experience 
 it as a voice often it's more like a 
 simple feeling 
 an energy a sense of i want to do this 
 or i don't want to do that 
 don't make it into a big deal a 
 mysterious mystical event 
 a voice from on high it's a simple 
 national human experience that we have 
 lost touch with 
 and need to reclaim the main sign that 
 you are following your intuition in your 
 life 
 is increased aliveness it feels like 
 more life energy is flowing 
 through your body sometimes it may even 
 feel a little overwhelming 
 like more energy than your body can 
 handle you may even 
 have the experience of feeling tired 
 from too much energy coming 
 through you you won't bring through more 
 energy than you can 
 deal with but it may stretch you a 
 little your body's expanding its 
 capacity to channel the universal energy 
 relax into it and rest 
 when you need to do things that help you 
 stay grounded 
 such as physical exercise being in 
 nature 
 emotional self-nurturing and eating 
 healthy 
 substantial foods soon you'll feel more 
 balanced 
 and you'll and begin to enjoy the 
 increasing intensity 
 at first you may find that the more you 
 act on your intuition 
 the more things in your life seem to be 
 falling apart 
 you might lose your job a relationship 
 certain friends or your car might even 
 stop working 
 you're actually changing rapidly and 
 shedding the 
 things in your life that no longer fit 
 as long as you refuse to let 
 go of them they imprisoned you as you 
 continue on this new 
 path following the energy moment by 
 moment as best you can 
 you will see new forms begin to be 
 created in your life 
 new relationships new work a new home 
 a new form of creative experts scion 
 or whatever it will happen easily and 
 effortlessly 
 things will just fall into place and 
 doors will open in a seemingly 
 miraculous 
 way you may have times when you will 
 just go along 
 doing what you have energy to do 
 and not doing what you don't have energy 
 to do 
 having a wonderful time and you will 
 literally 
 be able to watch the universe creating 
 through you 
 you're starting to expiry and it's the 
 joy of being a creative channel 
 specific examples here are a few 
 examples from my life 
 and the lives of my friends and clients 
 of the types of situations you might be 
 con 
 fronted within following your intuition 
 notice that the words in 
 parentheses are the thoughts and 
 feelings that might have held you 
 back or stopped you from trusting your 
 intuition in the past 
 leaving a party or meeting because you 
 realize you really 
 don't want to be there even though 
 you're afraid of what others 
 might think or you don't want to miss 
 something good 
 telling someone that you are attracted 
 to him or that you 
 would like to get to know him or that 
 you love him or whatever it is 
 that you're feeling because it feels 
 good to be open and tell the truth 
 even though you're afraid of being 
 rejected and it makes you feel 
 very vulnerable and one part of you says 
 you're just not supposed 
 to do that deciding not to write your 
 thesis because you really don't 
 feel very interested in it every time 
 you think about it 
 it feels like a terrible chore even 
 though you spent five years working 
 toward 
 it and your parents will be upset if you 
 don't get your degree 
 you'd really like to have the prestige 
 and you think you could get 
 a better job with it taking singing 
 lessons 
 music lessons a dance class or 
 whatever interests you because you have 
 a fantasy that you would 
 love to be able to sing play an 
 instrument or dance 
 even though you don't think you have any 
 talent 
 you're too old to learn now or you might 
 look foolish 
 not going to work one day because you 
 feel like you want 
 a quiet day to yourself to hang around 
 home lie 
 in the sun take a walk or even just lie 
 in bed 
 even though you always go to work and 
 think it's terribly irresponsible not to 
 if you're not sick 
 or you're afraid you might lose your job 
 or you think it's silly or friv allows 
 quitting your job because you hate it 
 and you realize that 
 you don't really need to do something 
 that you don't like even 
 though you're not really sure that what 
 you're going to do next and 
 you'll only have enough money to last 
 you for a few months 
 and you feel scared about not having the 
 security of a regular income 
 not doing a favor for someone who's 
 asked you to because 
 you really don't want to and you know 
 you'd feel resentful if you 
 did even though you're afraid you're 
 selfish or you might lose a 
 friend or antagonize a co-worker 
 spending a little money on something 
 special for yourself 
 or someone else on impulse just because 
 it makes you feel good 
 even though you're normally very frugal 
 and you really feel maybe 
 you can't afford it telling someone your 
 opinion about something because 
 you're tired of pretending to agree with 
 others even though you 
 normally wouldn't dare express yourself 
 that way 
 telling your family that you're not 
 cooking dinner because 
 you just don't feel like it even though 
 you're afraid you're being a 
 bad wife and mother and they all might 
 find out they don't need 
 you anymore and your whole identity will 
 be shot 
 not making a decision about something 
 because you're not 
 sure yet what you really feel about it 
 even though it makes you feel 
 uncomfortable and off balance to be in a 
 state of indecisiveness 
 starting your own business because you 
 have a strong feel 
 inside that you can do it even though 
 you've never done any 
 thing like that before well you've got 
 the idea 
 trusting your intuition means tuning in 
 as deeply as you can to the energy you 
 feel 
 following that energy moment to moment 
 trusting that it will lead you where you 
 want to go 
 and bring you everything you desire it 
 means being yourself 
 being real and authentic in your 
 communications being willing to 
 try new things because they feel right 
 and doing what turns you on 
 highly intuitive people many people 
 are already highly developed intuitively 
 some are 
 very much in touch with their intuition 
 but are afraid to act on it 
 in the world often these people will 
 follow their intuitive prompt 
 things in one specific area of their 
 lives but not in others 
 many artists musicians performers 
 and other highly creative people fall 
 into this category 
 they strongly trust and spontaneously 
 act on 
 their intuition within the bounds of 
 their art form thus 
 they are extremely creative and often 
 very productive 
 but they don't have the same degree of 
 self-trust and willingness to back their 
 feelings with 
 action in other areas of their lives 
 particularly in their relationships 
 and in matters of business and money 
 thus 
 we have the classic case of the artistic 
 type who is chaotic and unbalanced 
 emotional 
 lie and or inept or even exploited 
 financially 
 a classic example of this problem was 
 seen in the movie lady 
 sings the blues based on the life of the 
 great singer billie holiday 
 in one scene she is traveling with her 
 show on a grueling tour of 
 the country she is feeling exhausted and 
 depleted and yearns to go 
 home to see her husband and to rest she 
 resolves to cancel her 
 tour and follow her heart however her 
 business managers succeed 
 in convincing her that this move would 
 ruin her career that she 
 must continue on the road shortly after 
 giving in to their coup 
 mints she begins to indulge heavily in 
 drugs 
 from that point on her life takes a 
 downward and tragic course 
 naturally one such incident does not 
 ruin an entire life 
 but this movie provides a graphic 
 illustration of the way many artists and 
 performers give away their authority to 
 other influences around 
 dim and suffer the resulting inner 
 conflict pain 
 and loss of power in order to come into 
 balance 
 these people must learn to trust their 
 intuition and assert themselves in all 
 areas of their lives 
 many psychics also experience this 
 problem 
 they are very open receptive 
 and intuitive and do not block these 
 qualities as 
 many of us have done they may even give 
 their intuition free 
 rhine in their work or under certain 
 conditions once again 
 they may not fully trust and back their 
 intuition in every moment of 
 their lives especially in the area of 
 personal relationships 
 they may be too wide open to other 
 people's energies and often do not 
 know how to stay connected to their own 
 individual feelings and 
 needs how to assert themselves and how 
 to set boundaries 
 from my experience these highly 
 sensitive people often have problems 
 with their bodies either weight problems 
 or chronic illness 
 these problems are healed when they 
 learn to balance their recep 
 div intuitive nature feminine energy 
 with an equally developed 
 willingness to act on their feelings and 
 assert themselves emperor 
 sonal relationships masculine energy 
 many spiritual seekers who have spent a 
 good deal of time 
 meditating becoming very sensitive and 
 attuned to their energy 
 also have problems of imbalance the 
 seeker has a strong mental 
 image of what it is to be spiritual 
 loving open 
 and centered he or she wants to act out 
 this model at all times and thus 
 is afraid to act spontaneously or 
 express feelings honestly for fear that 
 what 
 comes out may be harsh rude angry 
 selfish 
 or unloving since we are human as we 
 risk expressing ourselves more freely 
 and honestly some of what comes out will 
 be unpolished 
 dis torted foolish or thoughtless 
 as we learn to act on our inner feel 
 inks 
 all the ways in which we've blocked 
 ourselves in the past are 
 cleared out and in that process a lot of 
 old stuff comes to the 
 surface and is released many old beliefs 
 and emotional patterns 
 are brought to light and healed in this 
 process 
 we have to be will aim to face and 
 reveal our unconsciousness 
 by the time we can see it it's already 
 changing anyway 
 if we pretend to be more together or 
 than we really are 
 we will miss the opportunity to heal our 
 selves i have found this to be a very 
 vulnerable and out of control 
 feeling i can't worry too much about how 
 i'm presenting myself or 
 how i look to others or whether i'm 
 doing the right thing 
 i just have to be myself as i am now 
 as best i can accepting the mixture 
 of enlightened awareness and human 
 limitation that is what i am 
 right now it isn't necessary to be 
 perfect to be a channel for the universe 
 you just have to be real be yourself the 
 more authentic 
 on a state and spontaneous you 
 are the more freely the creative force 
 can 
 flow through you as it does so it cleans 
 out the remnants of old 
 blockages what comes out may sometimes 
 be unpleasant or 
 uncomfortable but the energy moving 
 through will feel great 
 the more you do this the clearer your 
 channel gets 
 so that what comes through is an 
 increasingly perfect expression of the 
 universe 
 remember too that some of our spiritual 
 models reflect our 
 good ideas more than they reveal an 
 accurate picture of in light 
 in mint the picture that many people 
 have of wanting to be male 
 low positive and loving all the time is 
 really an expression of their 
 need to feel in control good and right 
 the universe has many call moods 
 speeds styles and direction furthermore 
 they're all constantly changing only by 
 letting go of some of our control 
 and risking moving fearlessly with this 
 flow will we get to express and 
 the ecstasy of being a true channel 
 exercise 
 one write down all the reasons you can 
 think of for not trust 
 ing and following your intuition include 
 on the list any fierce you 
 have about what might happen to you if 
 you trust your intuition 
 and act on it all the time 2. review the 
 meditation at the end of the third 
 chapter 
 the chapter on intuition see page 42. 
 3 at least twice a day more often if you 
 can remember 
 take a minute to relax close your eyes 
 and check in with your gut feeling to 
 see if you are doing what feels right 
 or if there's any thing you need to be 
 aware of 
 four for one day or one week assume that 
 your intuitive feelings 
 about things are always 100 right and 
 act as if that is so 
 chapter 12 feelings only of the most 
 common problems i 
 encounter in my work is that so many 
 people are out of touch with their 
 feelings 
 when we have suppressed and closed off 
 our feelings 
 we cannot contact the universe within us 
 we cannot hear our intuitive voice and 
 we sir 
 timly can't enjoy being alive it seems 
 that many people did not get enough real 
 emotional 
 support when they were growing up our 
 parents didn't know how 
 to support their own feelings much less 
 ours 
 perhaps they were too overwhelmed with 
 the difficulties and responsibilities in 
 their lives 
 to be able to give us the emotional 
 response and care we needed 
 whatever the causes if we don't feel 
 anyone is there to listen 
 130. to us and care about our feelings 
 or if we get a negative response when we 
 do express ourselves 
 we soon learn to suppress our emotions 
 when we bottle up our feelings we close 
 off the life in her 
 g flowing through our bodies the energy 
 of these unfelt 
 unexpressed feelings remains blocked in 
 our bodies causing emotional and 
 physical discomfort and eventually 
 illness and disease 
 we become numb and somewhat deadened in 
 every workshop i give 
 i encounter people who have been 
 repressing their feelings throughout 
 their lives 
 many people are afraid to feel their 
 so-called negative emotions 
 sadness hurt anger fear 
 despair they are afraid that if they 
 open up to expiry 
 incing these feelings the emotions will 
 be overwhelming 
 they are terrified that if they get into 
 the experience 
 they'll remain stuck forever 
 in fact the opposite is true when you 
 are willing to fully 
 experience a particular feeling the 
 blocked energy releases quickly 
 and the feeling dissolves when 
 counseling someone who has 
 blocked emotion i support them in moving 
 into the feeling and 
 allowing it to overwhelm them once 
 they've felt it completely and 
 expressed it it usually dissipates 
 within a few minutes 
 it's amazing to watch people who have 
 suppressed a painful feeling for 30 
 40 or 50 years release it within a few 
 minutes and experience 
 peace in its place it may be important 
 to have the support of a 
 therapist or support group during this 
 process 
 once you have experienced and released 
 blocked emotion from 
 the past a greater flow of energy and 
 vitality will enrich your life 
 it is important to learn to be in touch 
 with your feelings as they 
 arise in this way they can continue to 
 move through and your 
 channel will remain clear emotions are 
 cyclical in nature and 
 like the weather they are constantly 
 changing 
 in the course of an hour a day or a week 
 we 
 may move through a wide range of 
 feelings if we understand this 
 we can learn to enjoy all our feelings 
 and simply allow them to 
 keep changing but when we are afraid of 
 certain feelings 
 like sad nest or anger we put on our 
 emotional breaks when we start to feel 
 them we don't want to feel it completely 
 so we get stuck halfway 
 into it and never get through it often 
 people come to my workshops who want to 
 learn how 
 to think positively so they won't feel 
 so stuck in their negative 
 feelings they are surprised when i urge 
 them to feel more of their 
 negative feelings not less it's only by 
 loving and accepting all parts 
 of ourselves that we can be free and 
 fulfilled 
 we tend to think of certain feelings as 
 painful and therefore 
 wish to avoid them the experience of 
 pain 
 however is actually resistance to a 
 sensation 
 pain is a mechanism in our physical body 
 that helps us 
 avoid physical harm or notifies us that 
 a part of us 
 has been injured and needs care if you 
 touch a hot stove 
 you will feel pain this is resistance to 
 the sensation of heat that you are 
 experiencing it causes you to pull your 
 hand away and thus avoid 
 damaging your body if you do touch 
 something hot for too long 
 and burn yourself the subsequent pain 
 lets you know that your 
 body needs healing so on the physical 
 level 
 pain is a useful mechanism in that it 
 lets 
 us know that we are in danger however if 
 a sensation isn't 
 really dangerous you can relax into it 
 and the pain will diminish 
 and dissolve for example if you stretch 
 a muscle farther than 
 usual it will at first feel painful but 
 as you continue to relax 
 jen please and steadily into the 
 stretched position 
 the pain will be released in childbirth 
 if a woman resists the intense sensation 
 she 
 is experiencing she will have great pain 
 the more she is able to 
 relax into the sensation the less 
 painful it will be 
 on the emotional level it is our 
 resistance to a feeling that 
 causes us pain if because we are afraid 
 of a certain feeling 
 we sup press it we will experience 
 emotional pain 
 if we allow ourselves to feel it and 
 accept it fully 
 it becomes an intense sensation though 
 not a painful one there are no such 
 things as negative or positive feelings 
 we make them negative or positive by our 
 rejection or acceptance 
 of them to me all feelings are part of 
 the wonderful 
 ever changing sensation of being alive 
 if we love all the different feel things 
 we experience 
 they become so many rainbow colors of 
 life 
 here are some emotions that people seem 
 to be most afraid of 
 with a suggestion of one way you might 
 handle them 
 fear it's important to acknowledge and 
 accept your fears 
 if you accept yourself for feeling 
 afraid 
 and don't try too hard to push past your 
 fears 
 you will start to feel more secure and 
 the fear 
 will lessen take risks when you feel 
 ready to do so 
 but don't force yourself to do things 
 you aren't ready for yet 
 sadness sadness is related to the 
 opening of your heart 
 if you allow yourself to feel sad 
 especially if you can cry you will find 
 that 
 your heart opens further and you can 
 feel more love 
 if possible reach out for comfort and 
 support from someone who accepts you 
 and your sadness and can just be with 
 you grief 
 this is an intense form of sadness 
 related to the death 
 or ending of something it is our way of 
 releasing the old so that 
 we can be open to the new it is very 
 important to allow yourself 
 to grieve fully and not to cut this 
 process short 
 grief comes in waves at first close 
 together 
 then gradually further apart grief 
 can sometimes last a long time or recur 
 periodically for a very long 
 time it's necessary to accept it and 
 give yourself as much support 
 as you need to get through it whenever 
 it comes up 
 hurt hurt is an expression of 
 vulnerability 
 we tend to mask it with defensiveness 
 and blame so we won't have to admit 
 however 
 narrowbill we really feel it's important 
 to express feelings of hurt 
 directly and if possible in an ongoing 
 way 
 in other words i felt really hurt when 
 you didn't ask me to go with you 
 as opposed to you don't care about my 
 feelings 
 how could you be so insane sittiff and 
 so on 
 hopelessness this can be the result of 
 not trusting ourselves 
 honoring our feelings and needs nor 
 taking proper care of our 
 selves we may need to be more true to 
 ourselves and more 
 assertive hopelessness can also be a 
 stage we go through when we 
 are letting go of our old patterns of 
 control and learning to soar 
 render to our higher power anger when we 
 disown our true power and allow other 
 peo 
 full to have undo power over us we 
 become angry 
 usually we sup press this anger and go 
 numb 
 as we start to get back in touch with 
 our power 
 the first thing we feel is the stored up 
 anger 
 so for many people who are growing more 
 conscious 
 it's a very positive sign when they 
 begin to get in touch with their anger 
 it means they are reclaiming their power 
 if you have not allowed yourself to get 
 angry much in your life 
 you will start to set up situations and 
 people that trigger your 
 anger don't focus too much on the 
 external problem when this 
 happens just allow yourself to feel the 
 anger and recognize that it 
 is your power visualize a volcano going 
 off inside of you and fill 
 in you with power and energy often 
 people 
 are very frightened of their anger they 
 fear it will cause them to do something 
 harmful 
 if you have this fear see if you can 
 create a safe situation where you can 
 allow yourself to 
 feel it fully and express it either 
 alone or with the therapist or 
 support group allow yourself to rant and 
 rave 
 kick and scream throw a temper tantrum 
 throw or hit pillows whatever you feel 
 like doing once you've done this in a 
 safe environment 
 you may need to do it regularly you will 
 no longer be so afraid of doing 
 something destructive and you will be 
 able to handle the situations 
 in your life more effectively if you are 
 a person who has felt and expressed a 
 lot of anger 
 in your life you need to look for the 
 hurt that is underneath it and 
 express that you are probably using 
 anger as a defense mechanism 
 to avoid being vulnerable an important 
 key in transforming anger into an 
 acceptance of 
 your power is learning to assert 
 yourself learn to ask for what you 
 want and do what you want to do without 
 being unduly influenced 
 by other people when you stop giving 
 your power away to other 
 people you won't feel angry anymore 
 acceptance of your feelings is directly 
 related to becoming a 
 creative channel if you don't allow your 
 feelings to flow 
 your channel will be blocked if you've 
 stored up a lot of emotions 
 you have a lot of blocked energy or 
 erupting emotions inside of you 
 which don't allow you to hear the more 
 subtle voice of your into 
 i shin often people need help in 
 experiencing and releasing old emo 
 chanel blocks and learning to live in a 
 more feeling way 
 if you believe you need some help with 
 this 
 find a good counselor apist 
 or support group in seeking a therapist 
 ask people you know for referrals and 
 don't hesitate to interview several 
 until you 
 find one that you like try to find one 
 who seems to be in touch 
 with his or her own feelings relates to 
 you in a real and honest way 
 and supports you in experiencing and 
 expressing your own feelings 
 and entrusting yourself whether you seek 
 professional help or not 
 make a practice of asking yourself 
 frequently throughout the day how you 
 are feeling 
 try to learn to distinguish between what 
 you are thinking and how 
 you are feeling many people have 
 difficulty with this 
 as much as possible accept and enjoy 
 your feelings 
 and you will find that they open the 
 door to a rich 
 full and passionate life exercise 
 when you wake up in the morning close 
 your eyes and put 
 your attention in the middle of your 
 body your heart 
 your solar plexus and your abdomen 
 ask yourself how you are feeling 
 emotionally right now 
 try to distinguish your feelings from 
 the thoughts you're having in your head 
 are you feeling peaceful excited anxious 
 sad angry joyful frustrated guilty 
 loving lone lie fulfilled 
 serious playful if there seems to be an 
 anxious or upset feeling 
 inside of you go into that feeling and 
 give it a voice 
 ask it to talk to you and tell you what 
 it's feeling 
 make an effort to hear it and listen to 
 its 
 point of view be sympathetic loving 
 and supportive toward your feelings 
 ask what you can do to take care of 
 yourself at this time 
 repeat this exercise before you go to 
 sleep at night 
 and at any other time during the day 
 that feels 
 appropriate chapter 13 balancing being 
 and doing 
 is channels for the universe we must 
 have available a full range 
 of expression and emotion if the higher 
 power tells us to leap 
 we must be able to leap without stopping 
 to ask 
 questions if it tells us to wait 
 we must be able to relax and enjoy a 
 space of non-active 
 idi until the next message comes we will 
 always be pushed by our 
 inner guidance to explore aspects of 
 ourselves that are less devil 
 hoped to express and experience 
 ourselves in no ways 
 if we ignore these inner impulses we 
 will be forced by external life circum 
 stances to explore the opposite 
 polarities from the ones we are 
 most comfortable with one way or another 
 our higher self makes 
 sure that we get the message of what we 
 have to do at times we 
 138 may swing from one polarity to the 
 other until we come into ball 
 ants you can expect that your intuition 
 will lead you in directions 
 that are new and different for you if 
 you are comfortable 
 in one type of personality or pattern 
 you will probably be asked to start 
 expressing the opposite 
 it's good to know this especially when 
 you're in the process of learning to 
 hear your inner guidance 
 a good rule might be to expect the 
 unexpected 
 one of the most important sets of 
 polarities that we need to 
 develop and balance are the energies of 
 being and doing 
 most of us are more identified with one 
 of these energies 
 and disowned the other the two types 
 could be called the doers and the beers 
 they roughly correspond to type and type 
 b personalities 
 in common psychological terminology the 
 doers are people who are primarily 
 action oriented 
 they know how to get things done and 
 they usually aren't afraid to put 
 themselves out there and take risks in 
 expressing themselves are try 
 eating new things basically they are 
 good at expressing their outgo 
 in energy they have trouble receiving 
 they don't like 
 feeling vulnerable the most difficult 
 thing for them is doing nothing 
 not being engaged in some type of 
 constructive activity 
 unstructured time makes them 
 uncomfortable and they usually fill 
 it up with lots of activity they tend to 
 be driven and have a hard 
 time really relaxing their male active 
 energy is more developed 
 and they may be somewhat uncomfortable 
 with their female 
 receptive side beers are mainly oriented 
 toward inner attunement 
 they know how to relax and take it easy 
 they enjoy the subtle pleasure of life 
 and often know how to nurture themselves 
 and others 
 and how to play they are usually 
 flexible 
 and are happy to hang out with 
 unstructured time 
 they may have trouble with action they 
 fear putting themselves out in new or 
 unusual ways and tend to 
 hold back a lot they aren't very 
 assertive and sometimes have 
 trouble expressing feelings or opinions 
 they worry about what 
 others will think of them they may be 
 uncomfortable 
 in the world and lack the confidence to 
 deal with people 
 business money and so on 
 their female receptive energy is mortal 
 hoped and they may be uncomfortable or 
 distrustful of their male 
 outgoing side if you are primarily a 
 doer 
 your intuition will almost surely lead 
 you in the direction of doing less 
 your feelings will tell you to stop to 
 relax and take a day off 
 or a week or six months to 
 spend more time alone with yourself to 
 spend time in nature 
 too spend time with no plan and no list 
 and just practice following the energy 
 as you feel it 
 if you consistently ignore these 
 interims sages to slow down 
 you may develop a minor or major illness 
 this 
 may be the way the universe forces you 
 to become more balanced 
 the hardest thing for a doer is getting 
 no message at all 
 have aim to hang out and wait and do 
 nothing until further guidance 
 comes i am primarily a doer a list maker 
 a very active person and one of the 
 hardest things for me has been when the 
 universe has 
 forced me to do nothing yet i find that 
 those times are the most 
 powerful and inspirational of all 
 because that's when i can really 
 stop long enough to feel my spirit in 
 fact 
 i finally realized and had to admit that 
 i kept busy all my life 
 in order to avoid feeling that power 
 i was afraid of empty time and space 
 because it was 
 actually so full of the universal force 
 if you are more comfortable with being 
 you will undoubtedly 
 be pushed by your inner self into more 
 action more expression 
 more risk taking in the world the key 
 for you is to follow your 
 impulses and to try doing things you 
 wouldn't normally do 
 on impulse you don't have to know why 
 you're doing something or 
 see any particular result from it at 
 first it's important to simply 
 practice acting spontaneously on your 
 feelings especially when it 
 comes to dealing with people expressing 
 your creative energy in 
 the world making money or anything else 
 you might 
 normally avoid don't push yourself 
 harder or farther than you are ready to 
 go it's very important to respect your 
 own boundaries and rhythms 
 for growing make sure the voice isn't 
 coming from your 
 in or authoritarian self saying 
 you should put yourself out in this way 
 if it's a should it's seldom the voice 
 of the universe 
 rather follow the feelings you have that 
 guide you to practice expressing 
 yourself and building your confidence in 
 a supportive way 
 meditation get comfortable and close 
 your eyes 
 take a few deep breaths and each time 
 you exhale 
 relax your body and mind into a deep 
 quiet level of consciousness 
 imagine yourself as a very balanced 
 person 
 you are able to relax play and nurture 
 yourself frequent 
 lie and you enjoy having time and space 
 in your life when there is 
 nothing special you have to do yet you 
 act on your feelings and 
 impulses spontaneously express yourself 
 strongly and directly 
 and risk trying new things whenever you 
 are inspired to do so 
 you live in the full range of being and 
 doing 
 so you can follow your in or guidance in 
 whatever direction it leads you 
 exercise if you are primarily a doer 
 spend one day consciously doing 
 as little as possible take note of how 
 you feel and what happens 
 if you are better at being than doing 
 take a day to practice act 
 on any impulse or inspiration you have 
 without expecting 
 any particular results try several new 
 and unusual things 
 especially things that involve making 
 contact with people or putting yourself 
 out in the world in no ways notice how 
 you are feeling before 
 during and after you do this chapter 14 
 authoritarian and rebel t he 
 authoritarian and the rebel are two 
 parts of the personally 
 tie that many of us have in one form or 
 another 
 if they are strong voices in us they can 
 make it difficult to sense and follow 
 our 
 intuition if we are unconscious of them 
 they may control our 
 behavior in a way that interferes with 
 our ability to get in touch 
 with our true desires the battle between 
 them can create german 
 douse conflict within us as well 
 as in dealing with all of our inner 
 selves the first and most 
 important step is becoming conscious of 
 them once we become 
 aware of them we are already separating 
 from being identified 
 with them we recognize them as part of 
 us 
 and we begin to have 143 
 conscious choice about how much power we 
 give them 
 we can appreciate them for the ways in 
 which they've tried to help us 
 and for what they still have to offer us 
 the inner authoritarian carries our need 
 for order and strike 
 tour and the rules we have learned about 
 how we should behave 
 people who grow up in a home with a 
 strong authoritarian parent 
 figure or in a very authoritarian 
 religion always develop a power 
 full inner authoritarian self who 
 carries all the values and rules of 
 the external authority figures it tries 
 to protect you and keep you 
 safe by making sure that you follow the 
 rules maintain order 
 and behave as a good responsible person 
 if you have a strong authoritarian self 
 you usually make one of 
 two choices you strive to follow its 
 rules or you rebel against them 
 if you follow them faithfully you are 
 likely to be irresponsible 
 law abiding person and oftentimes a high 
 achiever 
 you may how ever lose touch with your 
 spontaneous 
 creative inner keys and eventually you 
 may even feel that you've lost your soul 
 some people react to their authoritarian 
 upbringing and their 
 own internalized authoritarian by 
 developing a strong rebellious self 
 they become identified with the rebel 
 and disowned the author 
 itarian self but it remains in the 
 shadow of their unconscious 
 dry aim to control their behavior and 
 constantly triggering the rebel 
 into action the rebel usually develops 
 in childhood or adolescence 
 in an attempt to maintain a sense of 
 self and find some freedom in an 
 overly oppressive rule structure this 
 can literally be a lifesaver at 
 the time unfortunately the rebel is just 
 a knee-jerk reaction to the 
 authoritarian's rules it reacts in 
 rebellion to any controlling influ 
 ants from inside or out it will 
 automatically do the opposite of 
 whatever it thinks it's supposed to do 
 thus 
 it is really no freer than the 
 authoritarian it's just the flip 
 side of the same coin it has little to 
 do with the person's true desires 
 it just does the opposite of what it's 
 told eventually 
 it becomes a self-sabotaging force 
 often inclined toward addictive and 
 self-destructive behavior 
 many people who identify with the rebel 
 were the black 
 sheep of their families acting out the 
 disowned energies of the 
 other family members they may continue 
 this pattern in later life 
 always becoming the scapegoat or shadow 
 carrier in every relation 
 chip the rebel will fight against any 
 energy it fears will control it 
 including legitimate authority figures 
 or your own internal 
 attempts to create positive structure in 
 your life 
 for example your boss might make a 
 reasonable request 
 and you become angry and resist doing 
 what she 
 asks you decide to eat a healthier diet 
 and your 
 rebel immediately eats three pieces of 
 chocolate cake you decide to 
 exercise in the morning and you find 
 you've slept until noon 
 as always when we are overly identified 
 with an energy 
 we attract its opposite in our 
 relationships 
 if you are identified with your 
 authoritarian voice 
 you will probably have a rebellious mate 
 rebellious children 
 and or rebellious employees if you are 
 identity 
 with the rebel you will constantly 
 attract authoritarian honor 
 keys into your life the police the irs 
 your mate your boss etc 
 whether we become overly identified with 
 the authoritarian or 
 with a rebel these identifications are 
 unconscious 
 so there is no real choice or freedom 
 when your authoritarian self is 
 dictating 
 your every move or is constantly 
 battling with your rebel 
 it is almost impossible to get in touch 
 with your intuitive feelings or 
 true desires the key then is to become 
 aware of 
 and learn to recognize both of these 
 energies 
 try to notice when one or the other 
 takes 
 over or when they are locked in conflict 
 once you become aware of them 
 acknowledge them for trying to help and 
 protect you 
 then see if you can drop in a little 
 deeper to intuitively sense what 
 it is that you really need and want in 
 this situation 
 a client of mine was frustrated with her 
 career and saw that she 
 was bringing about her firing she was 
 working in an office 
 doing administrative work for a 
 salesperson 
 although she had great organizational 
 abilities 
 she found herself forgetting to do 
 things her boss would come to her and 
 remind her of what hadn't been 
 done and she would fume with anger she 
 realized she was getting 
 angry any time her boss told her to do 
 something however reason 
 able she felt she could not afford to 
 lose the job 
 but she did not want to stay there 
 either 
 she felt trapped as we talked she start 
 ed to identify the rebel side of herself 
 she saw she was fighting 
 with the authoritarian who said she had 
 to stay at that job 
 and the best way that i have found to 
 become conscious of the different selves 
 within us 
 and work with them is the voice dialogue 
 technique of helen citra stones 
 c recommended resources 
 against her boss who was in a 
 controlling position 
 she went back to her childhood and 
 examined when she first developed a 
 rebel inside she saw that she'd had 
 trouble with authorities at 
 other jobs and in school she realized 
 she was being triggered by 
 old patterns when she saw this she 
 immediately wanted to change these 
 parts of herself i explained to her that 
 she could not force change 
 if she tried to change or fix her rebel 
 she'd be activating it 
 and the rebel would continue to fight 
 she needed to become willing to watch 
 herself react 
 to accept that this was the pattern she 
 was at 
 hang out once she had really grasped 
 what i was saying to her 
 i asked her to close her eyes and drop 
 into a deeper place inside her 
 self she needed to ask her intuition 
 what she really wanted 
 it turned out she wanted to be a 
 saleswoman but was afraid to 
 she was growing angry at herself for 
 sitting behind a desk 
 when she knew there was something else 
 she was meant to do 
 after realizing what she wanted to do 
 she was able to come up 
 with several steps she could take to 
 support her goal 
 she decided to keep her job for the 
 interim and enlist her boss's help in 
 her 
 goal she decided to conduct several 
 informational interviews at 
 sales companies to get ideas of places 
 she might want to work 
 having seen clearly what she wanted and 
 discussed the action she 
 could take to help herself she felt much 
 better 
 a month later she called me and said 
 that although her author 
 itarian and rebel continued to fight it 
 out they seem to have less 
 power she had continued to support her 
 goal to do sales work 
 and was feeling much better about her 
 life and less reactive to her boss 
 exercise identify some of your rules and 
 behaviors that feel demanding 
 and controlling overly authoritarian to 
 you 
 use the categories below in addition to 
 any of your own 
 i have given some examples in each 
 category 
 work i must work 40 to 60 hours per week 
 i must work hard to get anywhere i can't 
 make money doing what i want 
 money i'm never going to have enough 
 money i must save money 
 in case something happens i must not be 
 frivolous with money 
 relationships i have to find them eight 
 i must please my mate 
 i have to be monogamous i'd better be 
 satisfied with what i've got 
 sex i have to have an orgasm every time 
 i have sex 
 i have to be in love with someone to 
 have sex 
 i have to be the greatest most sen 
 sue i'll love her now write down any 
 corresponding rebel thoughts you may 
 have for example who needs work i'm 
 going to quit my job 
 or who cares about money anyway 
 i don't need it or i'll just do what i 
 want behind my mates back 
 after you've written out the 
 authoritarian and rebel dialogues 
 drop into a deeper place and ask 
 yourself what you most want 
 dis cover what is true for you 
 write down any thoughts or feelings that 
 come to you 
 chapter 15 relationships 
 our relationships in the old world have 
 often had a primarily extra 
 now focus we try to make ourselves whole 
 and happy by getting 
 something from outside ourselves 
 inevitably 
 this expectation results in 
 disappointment 
 resentment and frustration either these 
 feelings build up constantly and cause 
 continual strife 
 or they are suppressed and lead to 
 emotional numbness 
 still we cling to reela shin ships out 
 of emotional insecurity 
 or go from one to another searching for 
 that missing piece 
 that we haven't yet found we've been in 
 this tragic predicament for at least a 
 few thousand 
 years now we seem to be approaching a 
 crisis point 
 relationships and families as we've 
 known them seem to be falling apart 
 at a 149 
 rapid rate many people are panicky about 
 this 
 some try to re establish the old 
 traditions and value systems in order to 
 cling to a 
 feeling of order and stability in their 
 lives 
 it's useless to try to go backward 
 however because our khan 
 cisness has already evolved beyond the 
 level where we were well 
 aimed to make the sacrifices necessary 
 to live that way 
 in the past many people were willing to 
 hang on to an essentially dead riola 
 shinship for an entire lifetime because 
 it gave them physical and 
 emotional stability now more and more of 
 us are realizing that it is possible to 
 have deeper intimacy and ongoing 
 aliveness and passion in areola 
 shanship we're willing to let go of old 
 ideas about relationship 
 in order to search for these ideals but 
 we don't know 
 where to find them many of us are still 
 looking outside ourselves 
 sure that if we just find the right man 
 or woman to be with 
 we'll be blissful lie happy or thinking 
 that if only our kids or our parents 
 would 
 behave the right way then we'd be fine 
 we're confused and frust 
 traited our relationships seem to be in 
 chaos 
 and we don't have the old traditions to 
 lean on or anything new to take their 
 place 
 yet we can't go back we must move 
 forward into the unknown to 
 eight new kinds of relationship in order 
 to do this 
 it's important to understand that our 
 extra 
 now relationships reflect our internal 
 relationships with ourselves 
 my primary relationship is my 
 relationship with myself 
 all oath errs are mirrors of it as i 
 learn to love myself 
 i automatically receive the love and 
 appreciation that i desire from others 
 if i am committed to myself and to 
 living my truth 
 i will attract others with equal 
 commitment 
 my willingness to be intimate with my 
 own deep feelings creates a space for 
 intimacy with another 
 enjoying my own company allows me to 
 have fun with whomever 
 i'm with and feeling the aliveness and 
 power of the universe flow 
 ink through me creates a life of 
 passionate feeling and fulfillment 
 that i share with anyone i'm involved 
 with 
 taking care of ourselves because many of 
 us have never really learned how to take 
 good care of ourselves our relationships 
 have been based on trying to 
 get someone else to take care of us as 
 babies we are very aware and intuitive 
 from the time we are born we perceive 
 our parents emotional pain and neediness 
 and immediately begin to develop the 
 habit of trying to please them 
 and fulfill their needs so that they 
 will continue to take care of us 
 later on our relationships continue 
 along the same lines 
 there is an unconscious telepathic 
 agreement i'll try to do what 
 you want me to do and be the person you 
 want me to be if you 
 will be there for me give me what i need 
 and not leave me 
 this system doesn't work very well other 
 people are seldom 
 able to fulfill our needs consistently 
 or successfully 
 so we get dis appointed and frustrated 
 then we either try to change the other 
 people to better suit our needs which 
 never works 
 or we resign ourselves to accept less 
 than we really want 
 furthermore when we're trying to give 
 other people what they want 
 we almost and early ably do things we 
 don't really want to do and end up 
 resending 
 them either consciously or unconsciously 
 at this point we may realize that it 
 doesn't work to try to take 
 care of ourselves by taking care of 
 others i'm the only one who 
 can actually take good care of me so i 
 might as well do it direct 
 lion allow others to do the same thing 
 for themselves 
 this does not mean we can't care for and 
 give to others 
 it just means that we make a conscious 
 choice to give or not 
 based on what we truly feel rather than 
 out of fear or obligation 
 in fact the better we take care of 
 ourselves 
 the more we have to give what does it 
 mean to take care of yourself 
 for me it means trusting and following 
 my 
 intuition it means taking time to listen 
 to all my feelings including the 
 feelings of the child within me 
 that is sometimes hurt or scared and 
 responding with care 
 love and appropriate action it means 
 putting my most 
 important inner needs first and trusting 
 that as i do this 
 everyone else's needs will get taken 
 care of 
 and everything that needs to be done 
 will get on 
 the ed for example if i'm feeling sad 
 i might crawl into bed and cry taking 
 time to be very loving and nurturing to 
 myself 
 or i might find someone caring to talk 
 to until some of the feelings are 
 released and i feel lighter if i've been 
 working too hard 
 i'm learning to put the work aside no 
 matter how important it seems 
 and take some time to play or just to 
 take a hot bath and read a novel 
 if someone i love wants something from 
 me that i truly don't 
 want to give i'm learning to say no as 
 clearly and lovingly as 
 possible and trust that he or she will 
 actually be better off than if 
 i did it when i didn't want to this way 
 when i say yes 
 i really mean it there is a very 
 important point i want to make here 
 it can cern's something i was confused 
 about for a long time and finally 
 understood taking care of yourself does 
 not mean doing it all 
 alone creating a good relationship with 
 yourself is not done in 
 a vacuum without relationship to other 
 people 
 if it were we could all become hermits 
 for a few years until we had a perfect 
 relationship with ourselves and then 
 just emerge and suddenly have perfect 
 relationships with others 
 it is important that we are able to be 
 alone of course 
 and some people do need to withdraw from 
 outside relationships to a 
 certain degree until they feel really 
 comfortable with themselves 
 sooner or later though we need the 
 reflection that a relationship 
 offers us we need to build and 
 strengthen our relationship with 
 ourselves in the world of form through 
 interaction with other beo 
 full the difference in these approaches 
 is the focus 
 in the old world of relationships the 
 focus was on the other person and on 
 the relationship itself we communicated 
 for the purpose of try 
 aim to get the other person to 
 understand us and give us more of 
 what we needed in new world 
 relationships the focus is on build 
 in our relationship with ourselves and 
 the universe 
 we camu naked to keep our channel clear 
 and to give ourselves more of what 
 we need the words we speak may even be 
 the same 
 but the inner g is different and so is 
 the result 
 for example suppose i'm feeling lonely 
 and want my partner 
 to spend the evening with me although i 
 know that he is 
 planning to do something else previously 
 i might have been afraid 
 to ask for what i wanted directly i 
 probably would have stayed 
 home alone and focused on learning to 
 enjoy being alone 
 later when i talked with him i would 
 feel some resentment 
 though i wouldn't admit it either to 
 myself or him 
 nevertheless he would feel this 
 resentment and become guilty and 
 resentful toward me 
 none of this would come out in the open 
 until later when we were 
 having an argument and i might say well 
 you don't care about 
 my feelings anyway you never want to be 
 with me 
 at this point i'm communicating to him 
 telepathically my underlying feeling 
 that he is responsible for my happiness 
 now 
 hopefully i would be more direct from 
 the beginning 
 i'd say i know you have other plans but 
 i'm feeling a need for 
 connection right now and i would love it 
 if you would spend the 
 evening with me i'm taking 
 responsibility for asking for what i 
 want and in doing so i'm actually taking 
 care of myself 
 even though i'm asking for something 
 from him 
 the key here is that my focus is on 
 myself this is what i'm feeling and this 
 is what 
 i want i have to be willing to make 
 myself vulnerable to do this 
 but i have found that it is the 
 willingness to say what i feel and 
 want that makes me feel whole in a sense 
 i'm already feeling more 
 fulfilled because i was willing to back 
 myself up 
 everything is out in the open and he's 
 free to respond honest 
 lie hopefully he will check inside to 
 find out what's true for him 
 if he wants to fulfill my request that's 
 icing on the cake 
 if he doesn't i may feel sad or hurt 
 i'll communicate my feelings again i'm 
 doing it for my own sake 
 to keep myself clear and then let go 
 i'll use that evening as a time to go 
 deeper within myself and 
 strengthen my connection with the 
 universe i've found a very interesting 
 thing 
 when i communicate truth fully and 
 directly 
 in a non-blooming non-judgmental way and 
 say 
 everything i really want to say it 
 doesn't seem to matter so much 
 how the other person responds they may 
 not do exactly 
 what i want but i feel so clear and 
 empowered from taking care of myself 
 that it's easier to let go of the result 
 if i keep being on a stand 
 vulnerable with my feelings to my 
 partner family 
 and friend i won't end up with hidden 
 needs or resentment 
 when you take care of yourself this way 
 more often than not 
 you do get what you ask for if not the 
 next step is to let go go 
 inside yourself and tune into what your 
 intuition is telling you to 
 do next always let it take you to a 
 deeper connection with your 
 self and the universe thus an important 
 part of creating a loving relationship 
 with 
 yourself is to acknowledge your needs 
 and to learn to ask for what 
 you want we're afraid to do this because 
 we're afraid to appear too 
 needy it's the hidden unacknowledged 
 needs 
 however that cause us to seem to needy 
 they aren't coming out directly so they 
 come out 
 indirectly or telepathically people feel 
 them and back away 
 from us because they intuitively know 
 they can't help us if we aren't 
 acknowledging our need for help it's 
 paradoxical that as we recognize and 
 acknowledge our own 
 needs and ask for help directly we are 
 actually becoming stronger 
 it's the male within supporting the 
 female people find it easy to 
 give to us and we feel more and more 
 whole 
 following energy i have found that when 
 i'm willing to trust and follow my inner 
 gee it leads me into relationships with 
 the people from whom i 
 have the most to learn the stronger the 
 attraction 
 or reaction the stronger the mirror 
 so the energy will always lead me to the 
 most intense learning situation it can 
 be frightening at first to try to live 
 this way 
 we have always been terrified to trust 
 our own feelings 
 especially in the realm of relationships 
 and sexuality 
 because this energy is so intense 
 so changeable and unpredictable we fear 
 that utter chaos 
 will rain we're terrified of being hurt 
 or hurting someone else 
 we don't trust that the universe knows 
 what it's doing or else we 
 don't trust ourselves to be able to 
 accurately follow our inner good 
 ants and there's good reason for this 
 in the area of relationships we have so 
 many old patterns and addictions that it 
 is often diffie 
 cull to accurately hear our intuitive 
 inner voice 
 following your energy does not mean 
 acting out every impulse 
 feeling or fantasy that you have that 
 would be the road to chaos 
 in order to follow your energy 
 constructively it's important to be 
 aware of the various selves are voices 
 within you which may at times 
 have conflicting feelings and needs 
 through this kind of aware 
 ness you can begin to sense the deeper 
 intuitive feeling of where the 
 life force is trying to take you while 
 honoring important degree 
 mints boundaries and commitments you may 
 have with others 
 until now most of us have avoided 
 dealing with our fears by 
 constructing stringent rule structures 
 for all our relationships 
 every relationship is fitted into a 
 certain category 
 and each cate gory has a list of rules 
 and appropriate behaviors 
 attached to it this person is a friend 
 therefore i behave this way this person 
 is 
 my husband therefore he is supposed to 
 do these things 
 whisper son is in my family so this is 
 how we act with each other 
 and so on there's very little space left 
 to discover the truth of each real 
 relationship some people rebel against 
 these rule systems and purposely 
 create relationships that go counter to 
 our established cultural 
 norms sometimes this is the case with 
 non-monogamous reala 
 relationships homosexual and bisexual 
 relationships 
 and so on if motivated mainly by 
 rebellion 
 these relationships may be largely 
 reactions against the rules 
 and still may not involve a true attune 
 meant to our real needs 
 just as every being is a unique entity 
 unlike anyone else every 
 connection between two or more beings is 
 also unique 
 no really shinship is exactly like any 
 other 
 furthermore the nature of the universe 
 is constant change 
 people change all the time and so do 
 relationships 
 so when we try too hard to label and 
 control relationships 
 we destroy them then we spend a lot of 
 time and energy fruitlessly 
 trying to bring them to life again we 
 must be willing to let our relationships 
 reveal themselves to 
 us if we tune into ourselves trust 
 ourselves 
 and express ourselves fully and honestly 
 with each other 
 the relationship will unfold in its own 
 unique and fascinating way 
 each relationship is an amazing 
 adventure 
 you never know exactly where it will 
 lead it keeps 
 changing its mood flavor and form from 
 minute to minute 
 day by day year to year at times 
 it may take you closer to one enough er 
 at other times it may take you farther 
 apart 
 commitment and intimacy when we discuss 
 the idea of trusting and following our 
 honor 
 gee people often ask where the concept 
 of commitment fits into 
 this picture because we have been so 
 focused on externals 
 most of us have attempted to make a 
 commitment to an external relationship 
 what we are really committing to is a 
 certain set of rules i 
 agree to behave in such and such a 
 manner so that we can feel 
 secure about this relationship usually 
 these rules are not spelled 
 out clearly they're assumed people say 
 they are in a committed 
 relationship but seldom clarify to 
 themselves or each other 
 what exactly they are committed to doing 
 or not doing 
 generally in a romantic relationship one 
 assumption is that 
 the partners are agreeing not to have 
 sex with anyone else 
 even that is rather vague though as no 
 one defines what having sex 
 is often the implied agreement is not to 
 feel 
 sexual attraction toward anyone else 
 yet how can you make an agreement not to 
 feel something feelings aren't under a 
 conscious control 
 we can make commitments about how we 
 will behave 
 since we do have conscious control of 
 our actions 
 most people find that a commitment to 
 monogamous behavior is a necessity in 
 order to 
 preserve the sense of intimacy they 
 desire in a primary relationship 
 the important question is do we make 
 that commitment as a way 
 of controlling our partner i'll be 
 monogamous so you will have 
 to be to or from our own integrity i 
 choose to be monoga 
 mouse because i want the depth of 
 intimacy that it will create in my 
 primary relationship the real problem 
 with many of the commitments we make or 
 assume is that they don't allow room for 
 the inevitable changes and 
 growth of people and relationships if 
 you promise to behave by a 
 certain set of rules that come from 
 outside of you eventually 
 you are going to have to choose between 
 being true to yourself and 
 being true to those rules when you stop 
 being honest and real 
 there's not much left of you to be in 
 the relationship 
 you end up with an empty shell a nice 
 commitment 
 but no real people in it because this 
 type of commitment attempts to keep the 
 form of 
 the relationship from changing more 
 often than not 
 it simply doesn't last the fact is that 
 relationships to change form and no 
 commitment can guarantee that they won't 
 no external form can 
 give us the security that we seek you 
 could be married for fifty 
 years in the 51st year your spouse could 
 decide to leave you 
 if we only realize this it can save us 
 so much pain 
 people who divorce almost inevitably 
 feel that they have failed 
 because they assume all marriages should 
 last forever 
 in many cases however the marriage has 
 actually been a success 
 it's helped each person to grow to the 
 point where they no longer need the same 
 form 
 what causes the pain in many cases is 
 that we don't know how 
 to allow the form to change while still 
 honoring the underlying love 
 and connection when you are deeply 
 involved with another human 
 being the soul connection often lasts 
 forever 
 the intensity of energy in the 
 relationship 
 however increases or decreases in accor 
 dance with how much there is to be 
 learned from it at any given 
 time when you've learned a great deal 
 from being with someone 
 the energy between you may eventually 
 diminish to the point where 
 you no longer need to interact on a 
 personality level as much 
 or at all sometimes 
 the energy renews itself again later on 
 another level 
 we don't understand this so we feel 
 guilty 
 disappointed and hurt when our 
 relationships change 
 form we don't really know how to share 
 our feelings effectively with each other 
 and so we often respond to these 
 feelings by cutting off our connection 
 with 
 the other person this causes us real 
 pain 
 because we are actually cutting off our 
 own deep feelings 
 i have found that changes in 
 relationships can be less painful 
 and at times even beautiful when we can 
 communicate honestly and trust ourselves 
 in the process 
 most people believe that sacrifice and 
 compromise harnesses 
 sari in order to preserve a relationship 
 the need to sacrifice 
 and compromise is based on a 
 misunderstanding of the nature of the 
 universe we fear that there is not 
 enough love for us and that the truth 
 may be hurtful 
 in fact the universe is filled with love 
 and 
 the truth when we can see it is always 
 healing 
 when i'm willing to be honest and ask 
 for what i want to con 
 continue sharing my feelings openly i 
 find that the underlying truth in 
 any situation is the same for all 
 concerned 
 at first it may seem that i want one 
 thing and the other person wants 
 something else 
 if we both keep telling the truth as we 
 feel it 
 sooner or later it works out so that we 
 both see that we can have what we truly 
 want 
 for example a couple who are clients of 
 mine were experienced 
 in a great deal of conflict about their 
 work they were partners 
 is a very successful business she was 
 tired of the business and 
 wanted to do something else he loved the 
 work and wanted to 
 continue but did not want to do it 
 without her they fought khan 
 stantley about whether to solve a 
 business her desire 
 or continue and expanded his desire 
 once they began to communicate on a 
 deeper level they 
 uncovered their fears she yearned to 
 express herself creatively in 
 new ways but was terrified that she 
 would not be able to success 
 fully step out on her own without his 
 constant support 
 she was also afraid that she would not 
 be able to make as much money 
 and he would feel resentful about her 
 diminished contribution to the 
 family income he was afraid that he 
 would be unable to handle 
 the business successfully without her he 
 depended heavily on her 
 creative input and did not trust his own 
 intuitive capacity 
 also he feared that his working life 
 would be dull and drab without her 
 warmth and humor having expressed their 
 feelings fully 
 they were able to see that they were 
 both at the point of making a leap into 
 a new level of 
 independence and creativity they were 
 ready to let go of some of 
 their dependency on one another and 
 develop more trust in them 
 selves she gradually withdrew from the 
 business and started a new 
 and very different career which she 
 ultimately found very exciting 
 and rewarding he continued to run the 
 business and developed it 
 in new and interesting directions their 
 relationship was enhanced 
 by their increased independence and 
 self-confidence 
 for me commitment in relationship needs 
 to be based on a 
 commitment to myself to love honor obey 
 and cherish my own being my commitment 
 and relationship is to respect my own 
 truth and do my best to honor the other 
 person's truth as well 
 2. anyone i love i promise to do the 
 best i can to be honest 
 to share my feelings to take 
 responsibility for myself 
 to honor the khan connection i feel with 
 that person 
 and to maintain that connection while we 
 may have a strong desire and 
 intention to maintain a certain form of 
 relationship 
 a marriage for example we can't have any 
 absolute guarantees about a 
 relationship's form 
 real commitment allows for the fact that 
 form is constantly changing 
 and that we can trust that process of 
 change it opens the door to 
 the true intimacy that is created when 
 people share deeply and 
 honestly with one another if two people 
 stay together on this 
 basis it's because they really want to 
 be together 
 they continue to find an intensity of 
 love and learning with each other as 
 they 
 change and grow monogamy or not 
 people often ask me if i think monogamy 
 is necessary in a 
 primary relationship i usually answer by 
 sharing my own expiry 
 and as i mentioned earlier in this book 
 at one time in my life i 
 experimented with non-monogamous 
 romantic relationships 
 i found that while i had wonderful 
 ideals of love and freedom 
 emotionally it was way too painful for 
 me 
 i also realized that one of my 
 underlying motivations was my fear and 
 ambivalence 
 about commitment in relationship once i 
 learned about the many different selves 
 within me 
 i realized that some of my inner selves 
 are monogamous and some 
 aren't in fact i found this to be fairly 
 universal 
 we all have sir tain selves who would 
 love to be free to relate sexually to 
 others 
 spontaneously whenever they feel like it 
 we have other selves who 
 need and desire the security and 
 exclusivity of a monogamous reality 
 the vulnerable child within us in 
 particular will not 
 really open up in a non-monogamous 
 relationship 
 since showing our deep vulnerability to 
 another is a key to 
 intimacy if the vulnerable child is not 
 present in a relationship 
 we will not experience the depth of 
 closeness most of us 
 yearn for in sexual partnership 
 that level of intimacy is very important 
 to me so i came to 
 the understanding that for me a mutual 
 commitment to monaga 
 mouse behavior is an important element 
 in my relationship with my 
 partner we understand that attractions 
 to others are an inevitable 
 part of being alive we can feel and even 
 enjoy those attractions 
 while maintaining appropriate boundaries 
 if we are honest with 
 ourselves and each other these 
 experiences can be part of our bur 
 for more information on this issue i 
 recommend the book embracing each other 
 and 
 the tapes affairs and attractions by drs 
 hal and sidra stone sonal growth in the 
 growth of our relationship 
 romance when we meet someone who is a 
 particularly strong mirror for 
 us we feel an intense attraction or we 
 may experience it initially 
 as a repulsion or dislike either way 
 there's a strong feeling 
 if that person is of the sex we prefer 
 and has certain characteristics 
 we may experience the feeling as a 
 sexual attraction 
 when the energy is particularly strong 
 we have an experience we call falling in 
 love 
 falling in love is actually a powerful 
 experience of feeling 
 the universe move through you the other 
 person has become a chan 
 now for you a catalyst that triggers you 
 to open up to the love 
 beauty and passion within you your own 
 channel opens wide 
 the universal energy comes through and 
 you have a blissful moment of 
 enlightenment very similar to the 
 experiences some people have 
 after long periods of meditation this is 
 the most thrilling and passionate 
 experience in the 
 world and of course we want to hold on 
 to it 
 unfortunately we don't realize that we 
 are experiencing the universe within 
 ourselves 
 we recognize that the other person has 
 triggered this experience 
 and we think it is him or her that is so 
 wonderful at the moment 
 of falling in love we are accurately 
 perceiving the beauty of that 
 person's spirit but we may not recognize 
 it as a mirror of our own 
 we just know that we feel this great 
 feeling when we're with them 
 so we often begin to give our power away 
 to them 
 and start to put our source of happiness 
 outside of ourselves 
 the other person immediately becomes an 
 object some 
 thing we want to possess and hold on to 
 the relationship 
 becomes an addiction as with a drug 
 we want more and more of the thing that 
 gets us high 
 the problem is that we get addicted to 
 the bur sun's form 
 not recognizing that it's the energy we 
 want 
 we focus on the personality and the body 
 and try to grab onto it to keep it 
 the minute we do this the energy gets 
 blocked 
 by grabbing hold of the channel so 
 tightly we are actually strangling it 
 and claws 
 hang off the very energy we seek true 
 passion brings us together but our 
 neediness often takes 
 over shortly thereafter the relationship 
 starts to die almost as 
 soon as it blooms then we really panic 
 and usually hold on even 
 tighter the initial experience of 
 falling in love was so powerful 
 that we sometimes spend years trying to 
 recreate it but often 
 the more we try the more it eludes us 
 it's only when we give up and let go 
 that the energy may start to flow again 
 and we can express it's that same 
 feeling 
 such is the tragic nature of romance in 
 the old world 
 we've spent thousands of years trying to 
 work this one out 
 our favorite songs stories 
 and dramas reflect and reinforce the 
 externally 
 addicted nature of our relationships and 
 the resulting pain and 
 frustration in the new world we are 
 discovering something simple and 
 beautiful that can heal much of our pain 
 the greatest romance of 
 all can be our love affair with life a 
 love affair 
 i am finding that being alive is a love 
 affair with the universe 
 i also think of it as a love affair 
 between my inner male and female 
 and between my form and my spirit as i 
 build and open my channel 
 more and more energy flows through 
 i feel greater intensity of feeling and 
 passion 
 being in love is a state of being that 
 is independent of any one person 
 certain people however seem to intensify 
 or deepen my experience 
 of the life force within me i know that 
 those people are mirrors too 
 me and that they are also channels for 
 special energy in my life 
 i move toward them because i want the 
 intensification that i 
 experience with them i feel the universe 
 moving through me too 
 them and moving through them to me this 
 could happen 
 through any form of exchange the energy 
 itself lets me know 
 what is needed and appropriate it's a 
 mutually satisfying and full 
 filling exchange because the universe is 
 giving each of us what we 
 need it may be a brief one-time 
 experience 
 a glance or a short conversation with a 
 stranger 
 or it may be an ongoing contact a 
 profound relationship that lasts for 
 many years 
 i see it more and more is the universe 
 coming to me constantly 
 through many diff friend channels 
 what i have just written is an ideal 
 scene i certainly am not 
 living it fully at every moment many 
 times i am caught up in my 
 fears and insecurities however i am 
 experiencing it more and 
 more frequently and when i do it feels 
 wonderful 
 exercises 1. take yourself on a romantic 
 date 
 do everything as if you were going out 
 with the most loving and exciting 
 partner you can 
 imagine take a luxurious hot bath 
 dress in your best clothes buy yourself 
 flowers go to a lovely restaurant take a 
 moonlight stroll 
 do anything else that strikes your fancy 
 spend the evening telling 
 yourself how wonderful you are how much 
 you love yourself 
 and anything else that you would like 
 your hair from a lover 
 imagine that the universe is your lover 
 and is giving you everything that you 
 want 2. the next time that you feel a 
 romantic or a sexual charge 
 with someone remember that it's the 
 universe you are feeling 
 whatever you do whether you act on it or 
 not just remember that 
 it's all part of your true love affair 
 with life 
 chapter 16 our children 
 living as a channel for the universe 
 applies to parenting as much 
 as to every other area of our lives 
 while i don't have children 
 myself i have a number of friends who 
 are using these principles 
 in relating to their children it 
 certainly isn't easy to transform our 
 old concepts and patterns of raising 
 children but the results are 
 wonderful to see bright light radiating 
 from these children 
 status faction and fulfillment for their 
 parents 
 and the depth of clothes ness and 
 sharing between them 
 our old ideas of parenting usually 
 involve feeling totally 
 responsible for the welfare of our 
 children and trying to follow 
 behave your standard to be a good parent 
 as you learn to 
 trust yourself and be yourself 
 spontaneously you may find your 
 self violating many of your old rules 
 about what a good parent 
 does nevertheless the energy and 
 aliveness that is coming through 
 you your increasing sense of 
 satisfaction in your life 
 and your trust in yourself and the 
 universe 
 will do far more to help your child than 
 anything 
 else possibly could in a sense you don't 
 have to raise your children at all 
 the universe is the true parent to your 
 children 
 you are simply the channel the more you 
 are 
 able to follow your energy and do what 
 is best for you 
 the more the universe will come through 
 you to everyone around you 
 as you thrive your children will too 
 when babies are born they are powerful 
 intuitive beings 
 newly arrived in the physical world they 
 spend their first years learning to 
 live in a body their forms are younger 
 and less experienced than 
 ours but their spirits are just as 
 developed as ours 
 in fact i believe that we often have 
 children who are spiritually more 
 developed than 
 we are so that we can learn from them 
 our children come into the world as 
 clear beings 
 they know who they are and what they are 
 here to do 
 i believe that on some level of 
 consciousness 
 parents and children have made an agree 
 meant 
 the parents have agreed to support and 
 assist the child in 
 developing his form body mind and 
 emotions 
 and learning how to operate in the world 
 the child has agreed to help the parents 
 be more in touch with their intuitive 
 selves because children have 
 not yet lost their conscious connection 
 to their spirit 
 they provide us with considerable 
 support in reconnecting with our own 
 higher 
 selves our children essentially need two 
 things from us 
 1. they need to be recognized for who 
 they really are 
 if we see and know that they are 
 powerful and sophisticated spiritual 
 beings and relate to them that way from 
 the beginning they will 
 not need to hide their power and lose 
 touch with their soul 
 as many of us have their being will 
 receive the support and 
 acknowledgement they need to remain 
 clear and strong 
 2. they need us to create an example for 
 them of how to live 
 effectively in the world of form as we 
 do this 
 they watch how we live and imitate us 
 being very perceptive and pragmatic they 
 copy 
 what we actually do and not what we say 
 in return for taking responsibility for 
 these two things 
 we receive from our children endless 
 amounts of vibrant energy 
 unless they are shut down at a very 
 early age through a lack of sup 
 port children are very clear and 
 powerful channels 
 because they have not yet developed much 
 rational censorship 
 they are almost totally intuitive 
 completely spontaneous and absolutely 
 honest 
 from watching them we can learn a great 
 deal about how to fall 
 low energy and live creatively most 
 parents have not been able to fulfill 
 their responsibilities 
 as successfully as they would have 
 wished in general 
 parents have been confused about their 
 roles and responsibilities 
 they haven't had any clear models or 
 guidelines 
 until very recently inhuman history 
 no one did much research on parenting 
 and there are still 
 very few resources for educating oneself 
 about how to be a parent 
 most people parent in a rather hitoris 
 fashion 
 so everyone has made plenty of mistakes 
 i've met a lot of parents who now that 
 they have become more 
 conscious feel tremendous guilt and 
 sadness in looking back on 
 how they've raised their children it's 
 helpful to remember that chill 
 drain or powerful spiritual beings who 
 are responsible for their 
 own lives they chose you as a parent so 
 that they could learn the 
 things they needed to work out in this 
 lifetime 
 also it helps tremendously to know that 
 as you grow and 
 evolve they will be positively affected 
 and supported by your trends 
 formation they will change as you change 
 even if they are grown 
 and live far away from you all 
 relationships are telepathic 
 so no matter what the physical distance 
 they will continue to reflect you 
 because we have not been sufficiently 
 attuned to our own being 
 it's been hard to recognize and trust 
 the spirit within our children 
 because they were physically undeveloped 
 and rationally and syphilis 
 dedicated we thought they were less 
 aware and less responsible than 
 they really are i've observed in many 
 people the underlying attitude that 
 chill 
 drain are somewhat helpless or 
 untrustworthy and that parents are 
 responsible for controlling and molding 
 them into responsible 
 beings children of course pick up this 
 attitude and reflect it in 
 their behavior if you recognize and 
 treat them as powerful 
 spiri to olly mature responsible beings 
 they will respond accordingly children 
 is mirrors 
 because young children are relatively 
 unspoiled they are our 
 clearest mirrors as intuitive beings 
 they are tuned in on a feeling level and 
 respond honestly to the energy as they 
 feel it 
 they haven't learned to cover up yet 
 when adults do not speak or behave 
 according to what they are actually 
 feeling 
 children pick up the diss creep and see 
 immediately and react to it 
 watching their reactions can help us 
 become more aware of our own suppressed 
 feelings 
 for example if you are trying to appear 
 calm and collected 
 when inside you are feeling upset and 
 angry your children may 
 mirror this to you by becoming wild and 
 disruptive 
 you are dry aim to maintain control 
 but they pick up the chaotic energy 
 inside of you and reflect it in their 
 behavior 
 oddly enough if you express directly 
 what you are truly feeling without 
 trying to cover 
 it up i'm feeling really upset and 
 frustrated because i've had a 
 rotten day i'm mad at the world and at 
 myself and at you 
 i want you to be quiet so i can have 
 peace and quiet to try to sort out my 
 feelings will you please go outside for 
 a few minutes 
 they will usually calm down they feel 
 comfortable with the truth and the 
 congruity between your feelings and your 
 words 
 many parents think they have to protect 
 their children from 
 there the parents confusion or so-called 
 negative feelings 
 they think that being a good parent 
 means maintaining a certain role 
 always being patient loving wise and 
 strong in fact 
 children need honesty they need to see a 
 model of a human being going 
 through all the different feelings and 
 moods that a human being 
 goes through and being honest about it 
 this gives them promise 
 sign and support to love themselves and 
 allow themselves to be real 
 and truthful sharing your feelings with 
 your children does not mean dump 
 in your anger on them or blaming them 
 for your troubles 
 it also does not mean you can expect 
 them to be your partner or 
 therapist and help you with your 
 problems 
 the more you practice express in your 
 feelings honestly as you go along 
 the less likely you are to do these 
 things 
 being human however you probably will 
 dump 
 your anger or frustration on them from 
 time to time 
 once you see that you've done it tell 
 them you realize that you dumped on them 
 and that you are truly sorry and then 
 let it go 
 it's all part of learn aim to be in 
 close relationships 
 children also serve as our mirrors by 
 imitating us from a very 
 young age we are their model for 
 behavior 
 so they pattern them selves after us 
 thus we can watch them to see what we 
 are doing 
 children often reflect either our 
 primary selves 
 in the ways they are similar to us 
 or our own disowned selves in the ways 
 they are 
 different from us when they behave in 
 ways that we find upset 
 ting or mystifying they are usually 
 acting out one or more of our 
 disowned selves our shadow side for 
 example 
 a woman friend of mine is a very sweet 
 loving person who is a committed 
 pacifist 
 she was shocked and horrified to 
 discover that her little boy loved 
 playing with toy guns of course he was 
 reflecting her disowned 
 aggressive side when your child does 
 something you don't like 
 tell him or her how you feel about it 
 and deal with it directly 
 but also ask your self in what way that 
 behavior mirrors you or how you might be 
 supporting it in your own process for 
 example 
 if your children are being secretive and 
 hiding 
 things from you ask yourself if you have 
 been really open and 
 honest about all your feelings with them 
 is there something you 
 are hiding from someone or from yourself 
 is there some way you 
 don't trust yourself and therefore don't 
 trust them 
 if you're chill drain or being 
 rebellious 
 take a look at the relationship between 
 your own inner authoritarian and rebel 
 if your inner authoritary and has a lot 
 of control in your life 
 your children may be acting out your 
 suppressed 
 rebellious side or if you've acted out 
 the rebel a 
 lot in your life they may be imitating 
 you 
 take a good look at how these problems 
 reflect your inner 
 process if you learn from your 
 experiences and grow 
 so will your children externally 
 a lot of these problems can be worked 
 through by deeply and sincerely sharing 
 your feelings and learning to assert 
 yourself and by encouraging your 
 children to do the same 
 you may want to get support from a 
 professional counselor or family thera 
 piss to help the whole family change its 
 old patterns 
 i have found that for many people 
 parenting has been a conversant 
 excuse not to do their own learning and 
 growing frequently 
 parents spend most of their time 
 focusing on their children 
 trying to make sure that the children 
 learn and grow properly 
 in taking responsibility for their 
 children's lives 
 they abandon responsibility for their 
 own lives 
 this has the unfortunate result of 
 making the 
 children feel unconsciously that they 
 have to take responsibility for 
 their parents because their parents are 
 sacrificing for them 
 children may imitate their parents 
 behavior by taking responsible 
 itty for other people or they may rebel 
 against the pressure to con 
 form to their parents expectations by 
 acting out the opposite of 
 what their parents want parents need to 
 shift the focus of their responsibility 
 from 
 their children back to themselves where 
 it belongs 
 remember that children learn by example 
 they will tend to do what you do not 
 what you tell them to do the more you 
 learn to take care of your 
 self and live a fulfilling happy life 
 the more they will do the same 
 this doesn't mean you should abandon or 
 ignore your chill 
 dren it doesn't mean that you let them 
 do whatever they want 
 you are in a deep relationship with them 
 and like any other relation 
 ship it takes a lot of caring and 
 communication 
 it's important for all of you to express 
 feelings 
 make needs known and set clear 
 boundaries 
 furthermore you have accepted certain 
 responsibility 
 ties to care for them physically and 
 financially you have a right to 
 require their co-responsibility and 
 cooperation in that process 
 the key is in your attitude if you truly 
 see your children as 
 powerful responsible entities and treat 
 them as equal to you in 
 spirit while acknowledging that they are 
 less experienced than you 
 in form they will mirror that attitude 
 back to you 
 from the time they are born assume that 
 they know who they 
 are and what they want and that they 
 have valid feelings and open 
 irons about everything even before they 
 can talk 
 ask them for their feelings about things 
 they are involved in and trust your 
 intuition 
 and the signals they give you to know 
 what their answers are 
 4. example ask them if they'd like to be 
 included in an 
 outing or if they'd rather stay home 
 with a babysitter 
 trust your feelings about which choice 
 they are making and proceed accordingly 
 then pay attention to the signals they 
 give 
 if you take them on an outing and they 
 cry the whole time 
 next time try leaving them with the 
 babysitter 
 as they grow older continue to include 
 them in family desi 
 signs and responsibilities as much as 
 possible 
 allow them to make their own decisions 
 about their personal lives 
 this means they may sometimes have to 
 deal with the consequences of making sir 
 tame decisions offer them your love 
 support 
 and advice but let it be understood that 
 their lives are basically their own 
 responsibility 
 tai be sure you set your own boundaries 
 clearly 
 what is okay and what isn't making their 
 own decisions does not include the right 
 to take advantage of you above all try 
 to communicate your han 
 estate feelings to them and ask them to 
 let you know how they are 
 feeling almost all family problems arise 
 from lack of communi 
 cation your children certainly aren't 
 going to know how to calm 
 communicate clearly if you don't know 
 how it seems to be terribly difficult 
 for parents to give up living 
 their children's lives for them and 
 start living their own 
 in order to do this parents have to be 
 willing to admit how dependent they 
 really are on their children and how 
 frightened they feel about let 
 tango of them these feelings are usually 
 masked by a reverse 
 projection parents will tell themselves 
 that their children are 
 dependent on them and won't be okay if 
 their parents 
 start focus in on fulfilling their own 
 needs 
 i have found that this is a false issue 
 the real issue is the par 
 ins feelings of dependency on their 
 children which they usually 
 aren't even conscious of children are so 
 alive and exciting 
 parents often secretly fear that their 
 lives will be drab and dull without 
 their children or perhaps they are just 
 afraid to face themselves 
 once they recognize and acknowledge 
 these feelings they will 
 begin to deal with the emptiness within 
 themselves and their lives 
 they will begin to look at what they 
 want and how they can status 
 feed themselves they will begin to trust 
 their own gut feelings about 
 things and act on them at this point the 
 children really start to flourish 
 they are finally liberated from the 
 unconscious task 
 of trying to take care of their parents 
 they are free to make their own lives 
 worthwhile 
 the children start doing what they 
 really need to do for them 
 selves they can now become the channels 
 they truly are 
 one couple who are close friends of mine 
 have a beautiful 
 daughter since before she was born her 
 parents were aware of her 
 as a powerful being and felt that they 
 were in communication with 
 that being i was present at her home 
 birth a wonderful event 
 a few minutes after she was born i was 
 holding her and she 
 looked strongly and directly into my 
 eyes i had previously heard 
 that babies can't focus at such an early 
 age 
 it was quite apparent to me that she was 
 well aware of what was happening 
 she has been raised much as i have 
 described she has always 
 been afforded the respect that she 
 deserved and was treated as a 
 highly conscious entity as a result she 
 is a truly remarkable child 
 wherever she goes people remark on her 
 strong presence 
 it's easy to see that she is an open 
 channel for the universe 
 meditation get comfortable relax 
 and close your eyes take a few deep 
 breaths and move your awareness into a 
 deep quiet place within you 
 picture or imagine your child in front 
 of you look into his or 
 her eyes and sense the powerful being 
 within take a little time just 
 to be with this experience and receive 
 any feelings ideas 
 or emperors sons about who your child 
 really 
 is communicate to him or her in 
 your own words your respect and 
 appreciation 
 imagine that your child is communicating 
 to you his or her respect and 
 appreciation 
 if you have more than one child do this 
 with each one of 
 them this meditation is effective in 
 opening the love and calm 
 communication between you and your 
 children whether they are 
 infants or adults exercise 
 practice telling the truth to your 
 children and expressing your 
 feelings honestly with them even if you 
 feel vulnerable and uncalm 
 affordable about not being in control 
 ask them how they feel about 
 things and try to really listen to what 
 they have to say 
 if you are tempted to give advice ask 
 them if they want to hear it first 
 if they don't tell them your feelings 
 instead 
 chapter 17 work and play 
 our culture is obsessed with achievement 
 and productivity 
 as a result we have an epidemic of 
 workaholism in which most of us 
 push ourselves much harder than is 
 necessary or healthy 
 we need to learn to relax nurture 
 ourselves 
 and have fun some people carry the 
 opposite polarity 
 they know how to relax and play but have 
 difficulty focusing and working hard 
 enough to a calm 
 bliss things when you're following your 
 energy and doing what feels right 
 to you moment by moment the distinction 
 between work and 
 play tends to dissolve work is no longer 
 what you have to do and 
 play what you want to do when you are 
 doing what you love 
 you may work harder and produce more 
 than ever before 
 but you will experience such enjoyment 
 and pleasure in your work that at times 
 it may feel like play each one of us has 
 a true purpose and each one of us is a 
 unique channel for the universe we make 
 a contribution to the 
 world just by being ourselves every 
 moment there need not be 
 rigid categories in our lives this is 
 work 
 this is play it all blends into the flow 
 of following the universe 
 and money flows in as a result of the 
 open channel that's created 
 work is no longer some thing you have to 
 do in order to survive and sustain life 
 you know longer work just for the sake 
 of making money 
 instead the delight that comes from 
 expressing yourself becomes the greatest 
 reward 
 the money comes along as a natural part 
 of being alive 
 for some working and getting money may 
 no longer even be directly related 
 to each other you may experience that 
 you are doing whatever you 
 have the energy to do and that money is 
 coming into your life 
 it's no longer a matter of you do this 
 and then you get money for 
 it the two things are simply operating 
 simultaneously in your life 
 but not necessarily in a direct cause 
 and effect relationship 
 in the new world it's difficult to pin 
 life's work and trooper 
 pose down to any one thing in terms of 
 looking for a career 
 our old world concept told us that when 
 we became adults 
 we had to decide what our career would 
 be and then pursue an education or 
 other steps to achieve that career the 
 career would then be purr 
 sued for most or all of our life 
 in the new world many of us are channels 
 for a number of 
 things that may come together in 
 fascinating combinations 
 perhaps you haven't found your career 
 because it doesn't exist yet 
 your particular and unique way of 
 expressing yourself has never 
 existed before and will never be 
 repeated again 
 as you practice full lowering the energy 
 in your life 
 it may lead you in many directions you 
 may express yourself in a variety of 
 areas 
 all of which will begin to synthesize in 
 some surprising 
 interesting and very new creative way 
 you will no longer be able to say i'm a 
 writer or a 
 fireman or a teacher or a housewife you 
 may be a combination 
 of all of those things you'll be doing 
 what you love 
 what you're good at what comes easily to 
 you and has an element of challenge 
 and excitement to it whatever you do 
 will feel satisfying and full 
 filling to you it will no longer be a 
 matter of doing things now 
 for later gratification i will work hard 
 now so that i can get a bet 
 her job later i will work hard now so 
 that i can retire and enjoy my 
 life i will work hard now in order to 
 have enough money and time 
 to have a vacation where i can have fun 
 it's the fulfillment of 
 what you're doing at this very moment 
 that counts in being a 
 channel everything you do becomes a 
 contribution 
 even the sim plus things are significant 
 it is the energy of the universe moving 
 through us that trans 
 forms not just the specific things we do 
 when i write a book that has a certain 
 impact on a reader's life 
 it's because of the energy of the 
 universe that comes through me and 
 connects to the readers 
 deeper levels of awareness the words and 
 ideas are the icing on 
 the cake they are the things that enable 
 our minds to grasp 
 what has already been changed it is not 
 so 
 important that i wrote a book what is 
 important is that i expressed myself 
 opened up and allowed the creative 
 energy to flow through me 
 that creative inner g is now penetrating 
 other people and things in this world 
 i had the joy of that energy moving 
 through me 
 and other people had the joy of 
 receiving that energy 
 that's the transformational xp greens 
 whether you are washing the dishes 
 taking a walk or 
 build in a house if you're doing it with 
 a sense of being right where you 
 want to be and doing what you want to be 
 doing that fullness and 
 joy and the experience will be felt by 
 everyone around you 
 if you're building a house and somebody 
 walks by and sees you doing it 
 they will feel the impact of the 
 fullness of your experience 
 there lives will be transformed to the 
 degree that they are ready to allow 
 the energies impact though they may not 
 know what hit them 
 they will start to experience life 
 differently it's the same when 
 you're just being if you walk into a 
 room feeling whole 
 and expressing yourself in whatever way 
 feels right to you 
 then every one in the room will be 
 effective and catalyzed in their own 
 growth 
 process even though they may not 
 recognize it or know anything 
 about it consciously you may at times be 
 able to see the direct 
 result of your channel operating you 
 will see proof of it in watch 
 in the changes in people it is an 
 incredibly exciting and satisfying 
 experience you can see that it may no 
 longer be an issue of focusing on 
 one lifelong career at times in your 
 life 
 you may be led to focus and build 
 structure in one particular area of 
 knowledge or exper 
 ties you may choose to learn certain 
 skills that you will use to allow 
 your channel to function in a way that 
 it wants to function 
 if you do this you will be led through 
 the learning experience 
 easily and naturally the process of 
 learning will be just as satisfying as 
 the 
 doing in other words it is no longer 
 necessary to sacrifice in the 
 moment so that in the future you will be 
 able to have what you 
 want the learning process can be fun 
 joyful 
 and exciting you'll experience it as 
 being exactly what you want to be doing 
 at that 
 time practicing learning skills going to 
 school 
 all of this can be fun and fulfilling 
 when you are following your intuitive 
 good 
 ants the work you do as a result will 
 also be a learning experience 
 for example i teach workshops not 
 because i've mastered the 
 information and i am the expert but 
 because i love to share myself 
 in this way this sharing deepens my 
 learning experience 
 again there is no strong boundary 
 between learning and teaching 
 just as there is no wall between work 
 and play 
 it all begins to blend and weave into 
 one 
 integrated and balanced experience most 
 people do have some 
 sense at least deep inside of what 
 they would love to be doing this feeling 
 is often so repressed 
 how ever that it is experienced only in 
 the form of some wildly impractical 
 fantasy 
 something you could never do i always 
 encourage 
 people to get in touch with these 
 fantasies observe and explore 
 thoroughly your most incredible fantasy 
 of how you'd like to be 
 and what you'd like to be doing there is 
 truth in this desire 
 even if it seems impossible there is at 
 least a grain of truth in the image 
 it is telling you something about some 
 part of you that's wanting 
 to be expressed your fantasies can tell 
 you a great deal about yourself 
 many times i've found that people have a 
 strong sense of what they 
 would like to do yet they take up a 
 career that is very different 
 from their desire sometimes they go for 
 the opposite because they 
 feel it is practical or will gain the 
 approval of their parents or the 
 world they figure it is impossible to do 
 what they really want 
 so they might as well settle for 
 something else that comes along 
 i encourage people to risk exploring the 
 things that really turn them 
 on the following are examples of people 
 i've worked with and 
 their exploration of their true purpose 
 1. 
 a brilliant and talented woman i know 
 had been working 
 with sick and dying people for many 
 years although she was a 
 great nurse and a powerful healer it 
 became evident to her that she 
 needed to be where she could express 
 herself more creatively 
 with encouragement she started working 
 fewer days as a nurse and 
 began leading workshops and counseling 
 people because she's 
 doing this she feels more fulfilled and 
 those around her feel her 
 fulfillment as well 2. 
 joseph was a young man in his early 20s 
 following fam illy tradition he went 
 into business with his father and 
 brothers 
 he was very successful in real estate 
 and contracting 
 the problem was he knew there was 
 something else he wanted to do with his 
 life 
 after lots of encouragement from the 
 group in one of my work 
 shops he admitted that he wanted to work 
 in the arts 
 but knew his family would frown on it 
 he most wanted to be a dancer the first 
 step was admitting to himself what he 
 wanted to do 
 eventually he mustered the courage to 
 take dance classes 
 he had a lot of talent and immediately 
 attracted the attention of the teacher 
 he can't but to explore this form of 
 artistic expression 
 when he support ed his desires he 
 actually found that his family was 
 equally sup 
 supportive 3. a close friend of mine had 
 three children 
 no college at you cation and was living 
 on welfare 
 her desire was to get into bussy ness 
 she intuitively felt she was going to 
 handle large amounts of 
 money but considering her situation this 
 didn't 
 make sense nevertheless she decided to 
 explore some possibilities in the 
 financial district of san francisco she 
 was immediately hired as a 
 receptionist she went on to be an 
 administrative assistant and khan 
 continued to rise to higher levels of 
 skill and responsibility 
 she even to ali reached her goal of 
 being a stack broker 
 she loves what she's doing and her 
 children are flourishing as well 
 4. a woman who came to a recent workshop 
 of mine shared 
 that she'd been a talented pianist with 
 hopes of becoming a con 
 cert pianist then for several reasons 
 the most predominant being a lack of 
 faith in herself 
 she had given up her dream she started 
 working in an office and found that 
 between work and her chill 
 dren she had little time for her music 
 after 15 years she felt 
 it was simply too late to ever go back 
 to the piano 
 she felt the time she had lost in not 
 playing rendered hopeless any chance of 
 being 
 great despite all her doubts we 
 encouraged her to at least start 
 playing again i assured her that if she 
 was doing what she loved 
 it would come back to her easily as she 
 opened to this idea 
 she started opening to herself 
 her sense of hopelessness was replaced 
 by a renewed sense of power 
 she called later to say she had been 
 playing the piano and feeling great 
 about it 
 a friend had asked her to play 
 accompaniment for a choral group and she 
 was 
 feeling very excited about the musical 
 possibilities starting to happen for her 
 meditation sit or lie down in a 
 comfortable position 
 close your eyes and relax take several 
 slow 
 deep breaths relaxing your body more 
 deeply with each breath take several 
 more breaths and relax your 
 mind release and relax all the tension 
 in your body 
 if you want imagine that your body is 
 almost sinking into the floor 
 bed or chair from this very relaxed 
 place inside 
 imagine that you are doing exactly what 
 you want in your life 
 you have a fabulous career that is fun 
 and fulfilling for you 
 you are now doing what you've always 
 fantasized about and getting well paid 
 for it 
 you feel relaxed energized creative and 
 powerful 
 you're suck successful at what you do 
 because it is exactly what you want to 
 be 
 doing you follow your intuition moment 
 to moment and are richly 
 rewarded for it exercises 
 1. follow any impulses you have in the 
 direction of your true 
 work slash play slash creative desires 
 even if it seems totally unrealistic 
 full 
 load the impulse anyway for example 
 if you're 65 years old and have always 
 wanted to be a ballet dancer 
 go to a ballet class and observe or 
 if you want take a beginning class watch 
 some 
 ballet and imagine that you're a dancer 
 while alone at home 
 put on some music and dance 
 this will get you in touch with the part 
 of yourself that wants to be expressed 
 that way 
 you may end up dancing much more than 
 you thought possible 
 and you may be led to other forms of 
 expression that will feel as good 
 2. list any fantasies you've had around 
 work 
 career or creative idi and beside that 
 list the action you plan to take to 
 explore this 
 3. write an ideal scene a description of 
 your perfect job 
 or career exactly as you would like it 
 to be write it in the present 
 tense as if it were already true put in 
 enough description and 
 details to make it seem very real put it 
 away somewhere 
 and look edit again in a few months or 
 even a year or two 
 unless you're fonta psy has changed 
 completely in that time 
 chances are that you will find you have 
 made significant progress in the 
 direction of your 
 dream chapter 18 money 
 money is a symbol of our creative energy 
 we have invented a 
 system whereby we use pieces of paper or 
 metal to represent a sir 
 obtain unit of creative energy for 
 example 
 you earn money by using your energy then 
 you trade that money to me in exchange 
 for the 
 energy i put into writing this book or 
 leading a workshop 
 and so fourth because the creative 
 energy of the universe in all of us 
 is lim eightless and readily available 
 so potentially is money when we fall 
 low our inner guidance and move with the 
 flow of energy in our 
 lives we find we have enough money to do 
 the things we truly need 
 and want to do a shortage of money often 
 mirrors the fact that 
 our energy is blocked in other ways your 
 ability to earn and spend money 
 abundantly and wisely is 
 based on your ability to be a channel 
 for the universe 
 the stronger and more open your channel 
 is 
 the more will flow through it the more 
 you are willing to trust yourself 
 and take the risks to follow your inner 
 guidance 
 the more likely you are to have all the 
 money you need 
 the universe will pay you to be yourself 
 and do what 
 you really love money in the old world 
 the old world is based on our attachment 
 to the external 
 physical world we look for satisfaction 
 from external things 
 because we believe that survival depends 
 on getting things 
 we may think that fulfillment can be 
 found in material wealth 
 in the old world you can build a strong 
 financial structure and 
 earn lots of money by learning how to 
 act effectively in the world 
 the old male energy however because your 
 actions are not based 
 on the guidance of the universe that 
 comes from the inner female 
 building your financial structure will 
 often involve fear 
 competition and struggle and you will 
 pay a high price for the money 
 you can earn money but find that you are 
 ruled by it 
 you think the money itself is important 
 if i have enough money i can do these 
 things and then i'll be happy or if i 
 have enough money 
 then i'll feel good about myself and 
 i'll be happy 
 or other people will like me if i have 
 enough money and that will make me happy 
 from this point of view money is seen to 
 be the important thing 
 but as long as it is valued in this way 
 money is always a problem 
 if you have too little money you're 
 always struggling to get 
 more money and always afraid there won't 
 be enough 
 there's always that terrible pain inside 
 that you don't have enough of what 
 you need on the other hand from this 
 perspective 
 even if you have a lot of money it's 
 painful because you're always afraid 
 you're 
 going to lose it you can never have 
 enough money to ensure that 
 you won't be afraid people with little 
 money seldom realize that people who 
 have 
 a lot of money are also frightened they 
 are basically insecure 
 because they never know if they might 
 lose their money 
 circumstances out of their control might 
 arise they might 
 make a foolish investment or somebody 
 might steal their money 
 if security is based on having money 
 it doesn't matter whether you have a 
 little or a lot 
 you're going to be afraid if we don't 
 realize that money is a symbol of 
 infinite energy 
 and we think there is only a limited 
 amount of it in the world 
 we're stuck with two options we can 
 choose to have a lot of money 
 and feel guilty or we can choose to do 
 without and resent those 
 who have more if you chose to have money 
 you will live with the 
 knowledge that others have less than you 
 you may fear that you're 
 having more causes others to have less 
 you may choose to deal 
 with the guilt by trying to deny or 
 ignore the feeling or you may 
 choose to ease your conscience by 
 attempting to help those who 
 are less fortunate on the other hand 
 you can choose to say i won't carry that 
 guilt i won't take more than my share i 
 don't care about money 
 anyway therefore i will keep what i have 
 to a minimum 
 i'll make sure that i am not taking from 
 somebody else 
 the problem with this attitude is that 
 you may end up 
 feeling deprived you see all the 
 beautiful 
 wonderful things in the world that you 
 would like to 
 have and enjoy but you can't you see 
 other people who have more 
 than their share of money and you resent 
 them basically 
 in this old world framework we must 
 choose either guilt or resentment 
 the old world structure demands we do 
 things out of our indie 
 vigil strength instead of allowing the 
 universe to do it 
 we think we have to work really hard to 
 get what we want 
 the work ethic that says work hard 
 sacrifice and struggle most of us have 
 that's so deeply embedded in us that we 
 don't allow ourselves to suck 
 seed financially or in any other way 
 except through hard work 
 struggle and sacrifice if you are 
 succeeding and making money 
 you are also paying a price emotionally 
 and often physically 
 people frequently drive themselves to 
 the point of sickness or death 
 they struggle and sacrifice emotionally 
 and in the end even though they have 
 achieved worldly success 
 they still feel deprived and empty or 
 people refuse to go after it at all look 
 what it leads to 
 struggle sacrifice pain and deprivation 
 of oneself 
 so i simply won't deal with it 
 i'll get by on the absolute minimum 
 amount of 
 money in my own life often more 
 sensitive 
 spiritually inclined people choose this 
 route so they can focus on more 
 meaningful things 
 the problem with this is you're actually 
 depriving yourself 
 of dealing with one of the most exciting 
 and beautiful things in 
 life if you're denying money you're also 
 denying a big part of the 
 energy of the universe and the way the 
 world works 
 people who choose the denial root 
 usually don't know how to handle money 
 and refuse to learn anything about it 
 money in the new world 
 the new world is based on trust of the 
 universe within us 
 we recognize that the creative 
 intelligence and energy of the universe 
 is the fundamental source of everything 
 once we connect with 
 this and surrender to it everything is 
 ours 
 emptiness is filled from the inside 
 we realize that money is a reflection of 
 the energy moving 
 through our channel the more we learn to 
 operate in the world based 
 on trust in our intuition the stronger 
 our channel will be in the more 
 money we are likely to have the money in 
 our life is based on our 
 ability to listen to our inner guidance 
 and risk acting on it 
 when you let go of trying to control and 
 you learn how to listen to the 
 universe and act on it money 
 increasingly comes into your life 
 it flows in an easy effortless 
 and joyful way because there is no sack 
 rufus involved 
 you are no longer attached to it instead 
 you can 
 experience the joy of learning how to 
 follow the energy of the uni 
 verse money is an extra bonus in the 
 process 
 you know that the money is not really 
 yours it belongs to 
 the universe you act as a caretaker or 
 steward for the money 
 you use it only as you are directed by 
 the universe through your own 
 intuition there is no fear of loss 
 because you know you are always 
 taken care of the money may come or go 
 but you can't lose the joy and 
 fulfillment in your life 
 when you feel this secure and free you 
 often attract more and more money 
 so that you are continual lie push to 
 deepen your trust at more intense levels 
 with higher 
 stakes ultimately as channels 
 many of us will be called upon to handle 
 large amounts of money from this place 
 of surrender and 
 commitment to the higher power this is 
 one of the ways that the 
 power of the universe can be wielded 
 effectively to transform the 
 world active and receptive there are 
 active 
 and receptive aspects of the process of 
 chan 
 milling money as in every other creative 
 process 
 the masculine or active way of making 
 money is to go out after something 
 you see something you want and go for it 
 the feminine or receptive way of making 
 money is to attract what you want to you 
 we have to be able to do both we need to 
 release the outcome 
 in energy that wants to move toward a 
 certain goal and risk fear 
 leslie acting on it we also need to 
 practice nurturing ourselves 
 appreciating ourselves and becoming 
 attuned to our inner selves 
 so that we can attract and receive what 
 we want many people are 
 developed on one side or the other they 
 either know how to go 
 after things but have a hard time 
 attracting things to them 
 or they know how to attract things but 
 are afraid to go out after them 
 often a balancing process is necessary 
 you may need to learn to 
 receive the gifts appreciation love 
 and energy coming to you or 
 you may need to practice outflowing your 
 energy into the world 
 which keeps it flowing through your 
 channel this way 
 the inner g doesn't get blocked on 
 either end 
 this means on a practical level you have 
 to be willing to take 
 some risks in the area of work and money 
 if you do only what you 
 think you should do in order to make 
 money and be secure 
 then you won't listen to the intuitive 
 voice that tells you what you real 
 li need to do this can be very scary 
 when it entails your job and your money 
 people often want to know what do i do 
 if my intuition tells me 
 not to go to work one day what do i do 
 then 
 will i lose my job if taking off a day 
 from work seems too risky 
 it may not be the best choice for you 
 yet 
 you may need to strengthen your chan now 
 by following your impulses in smaller 
 ways at first 
 you may call in and take half a day off 
 or you may plan for a three-day 
 weekend one day though you may wake up 
 and know 
 i just don't want to go to work and you 
 will follow through with this 
 and feel good about it usually when my 
 insides tell me to take 
 time off i need some nurturing some 
 peace and quiet 
 some out of time for inspiration to come 
 through 
 or time to simply feel old feelings 
 stirring up inside 
 feelings that need to be felt and 
 released 
 if you risk following your impulse 
 you'll find 
 maybe a few hours or days later your 
 energy will actually 
 be renewed you'll be able to go back and 
 do what needs to be done in a fourth of 
 the 
 time you will do it in a much more 
 inspired and creative way 
 anything can happen if you risk and 
 trust yourself 
 while home you may receive a phone call 
 from a person offering you a better 
 job that pays much more money that 
 happened to a friend of 
 mine you may get a creative inspiration 
 that will open up a fun 
 prosperous opportunity for you or you 
 may get an inspiration to 
 go visit someone who will give you a 
 lead to a great adventure 
 if you hate your job though 
 your energy for it won't come back also 
 because your true creative energy is 
 blocked you'll continue 
 to feel blocked financially eventually 
 you will probably leave your 
 job because you cannot stay stuck in 
 such a place for long 
 basically the whole issue of money is 
 doing what you really 
 want to do as much of the time as 
 possible the universe will 
 reward you for taking risks on its 
 behalf it's important 
 though that the risks you take are 
 proportionate to the level of structure 
 you're building in other words if you're 
 just beginning to learn 
 how to trust and follow your intuition 
 you probably don't want to 
 make a million dollar deal on a gut 
 feeling you probably don't 
 want to leap off a building and hope 
 that you can fly 
 it is emperor 10 that you build small 
 things first 
 practice following you're into action in 
 everyday things 
 say no even though you're feeling 
 pressured to say 
 yes do the thing you want to do even 
 though you 
 don't know why do it on an impulse make 
 that call 
 enroll in that class think of the things 
 you love to do 
 and do them this will strengthen you to 
 the point where you can make the big 
 leaps 
 balance once you understand the basic 
 process of learning how to fall 
 low your intuition and act on it you 
 have your groundwork for 
 channeling money there are though some 
 aspects of relating 
 more specifically to money that are 
 important to know 
 balance is an important quality to 
 develop in building the struck 
 tour of your channel if you have been 
 extreme in one direction 
 you may have to go to the extreme in the 
 other direction in order to empty 
 great and balance both aspects of 
 everything for 
 example if you have been very careless 
 and casual about money 
 or if you have been a person who has 
 denied the existence or importance of 
 money in 
 your life you may need to build 
 structures specifically 
 related to money these include 
 learning to balance your checkbook 
 budget 
 in money and gaining an understanding of 
 the rules that govern 
 how money works in the world you will 
 find these practices inter 
 esting even fascinating they are no 
 longer something that will 
 block you from the spirit they will open 
 the way for you to have 
 more spirit flowing through you people 
 who have little 
 understanding of money have usually 
 chosen to avoid structure on 
 one level or another because they feel 
 rules 
 regulations and details will keep them 
 from experiencing the 
 magic of life they're afraid they'll 
 spend all their time in their 
 rational mind instead of following their 
 flow 
 if you have this fear tune in and ask 
 the universe for guidance 
 you'll want to do this in a way that 
 makes you feel good 
 perhaps it would help to hire someone to 
 show you how to organize your finances 
 it does not have to be a painful process 
 you'll find it to be energizing and 
 supportive in your life 
 as opposed to painful and boring those 
 who have already applied a great deal of 
 structure too 
 working with money in the world may need 
 to let go and relax that 
 structure it's time to stop following 
 your rules and allow the 
 inspired aspect of the spirit of money 
 to work in your life 
 trust your intuition to guide you and 
 take more risks in doing things 
 differently than usual similarly if 
 you've been a person 
 who has saved your money and been very 
 careful about spending it 
 you need to learn to spend more 
 impulsively based on your intuition 
 spend on the basis of a gut feeling of 
 wanting something 
 learn to follow these impulses and 
 you'll find you won't end up broke 
 in fact it actually creates a greater 
 flow of money in your life 
 you're able to release and give it out 
 based on your intuition if you have been 
 a spin thrift and always spent more than 
 you 
 actually have you will probably need to 
 plan more and budget 
 again do it in accordance with an inner 
 feeling 
 if you're open to it your intuition will 
 tell you 
 hey learn something about plan ning 
 learn something about budgeting it will 
 support and help 
 you it won't make you feel restricted 
 if you follow your intuition about this 
 you will be led to people who can show 
 you how to do 
 it and it will be an interesting process 
 again 
 it will support your channel 
 focus another important thing to know 
 about how money works is 
 that it will always flow into whatever 
 you've created in your life 
 to receive it because it's energy 
 it will be attracted to what you need or 
 want or envision 
 if you have always operated on a 
 survival level 
 with money having only enough money to 
 take care of your basic 
 needs that's where your money will go if 
 you start to attract 
 more money into your life you may have 
 the tendency to increase your 
 if you have serious chronic money 
 problems or debts i recommend getting 
 help 
 from debtors anonymous one of the 12 
 step programs 
 basic needs and still only make enough 
 to survive 
 that's what happened to me for a long 
 time i had an 
 underlying program that said i can only 
 have as much money as 
 i need it's not okay to have more than i 
 need 
 consequently i created more needs 
 and ones that weren't particularly 
 rewarding 
 my car would break down and i'd have 
 expensive repair bills 
 or my cat would get sick and i'd have an 
 expensive vet bill 
 any extra money that came in would go 
 towards something that was a number 
 jincy or a basic need there was still 
 nothing extra for fun and 
 out of play or greater luxury i found 
 that i needed to create a budget that 
 included what i 
 wanted as well as what i needed i 
 started at a reasonable level 
 i'd like to buy at least one item of 
 clothing each month that's fun or 
 more luxurious i'd also like to do some 
 activity that would be 
 fun i would include these in my budget 
 and the money for them 
 would then flow in that's the power of 
 budgeting 
 a budget is like a blueprint if you 
 create a list 
 a picture in your mind of what you want 
 to have in your life 
 you will create the necessary money you 
 can just keep expanding step by step 
 my money history for most of my adult 
 life i had very little money 
 i never focused much on money i wasn't 
 particularly 
 interested in it essentially i did 
 whatever i had to do to pay my rent and 
 bills 
 but i put most of my time and attention 
 into my education 
 and my pursuit of consciousness and 
 creative expansion 
 i always did whatever i needed to get 
 the money various 
 projects housework odd jobs even my own 
 business 
 only one time in my entire life did i 
 have a nine-to-five job 
 for six months i was used to living on 
 the edge without much sense of where 
 my money was coming from in those years 
 i learned to trust that 
 somehow the money would be there 
 sometimes i would get down 
 to my last dollar and then somehow or 
 other more money would 
 come i was always cared for 
 then gradually as i began to use this 
 process more and more 
 learning to trust my intuition and act 
 on it learning to listen to my 
 inner guidance and risk putting myself 
 out in the world 
 i devil oaked a career counseling people 
 teaching workshops writing and 
 publishing books as i followed my 
 passion 
 i began to earn more money and to lead a 
 more abundant lifestyle 
 it continued to the point where i was 
 actually making a good income and living 
 in a 
 beautiful apartment doing most of the 
 things that i wanted to do 
 i came to count on that amount of money 
 although it was never 
 a secure thing i was still living from 
 month to month 
 but money always seemed to keep flowing 
 i constantly affirmed my trust in the 
 universe to take care of me 
 and i tried to follow its guidance but a 
 time came 
 all of a sudden when i had no money some 
 unexpected things happened and i was 
 caught short 
 i paid my rent and my bills and i looked 
 in my checkbook and there was noth 
 ing left i didn't have any savings or 
 other resources to fall back on 
 that was a very startling experience 
 because by that time 
 i was used to having a certain amount of 
 money 
 what amazed me about this experience is 
 that i had only five 
 minutes of fear i thought oh my god 
 what am i going to do then i felt 
 totally calm 
 i had to have that five minutes of fear 
 and then 
 it was as if there were no more fears 
 about money left 
 after that i knew i was going to be okay 
 a key point to this is that i knew i 
 would be willing to do what 
 ever the universe asked me to do i 
 remember thinking 
 well i love my apartment but i could 
 give it up 
 i love all the things i have but 
 i could give them up if the universe 
 wants me to go live in a tent 
 in someone's backyard i'll do that it 
 will probably be 
 wonderful there was an incredible 
 feeling of trust and knowing that none 
 of the things i might lose were that 
 important whatever i did 
 next even though it might be totally 
 different would be wonder 
 full too i would be taken care of 
 it wasn't just an intellectual knowing 
 because i had already known this 
 intellectually for a long 
 time living through those five minutes 
 of fear left me with a feel 
 in a fearlessness emotionally i knew 
 that i was okay 
 it was a very profound experience 
 i ended up cutting back a little bit on 
 my expenses and lifestyle 
 that felt fine and i didn't feel 
 deprived at all 
 in fact it was a nice discipline for a 
 while 
 everything i needed was provided money 
 came in to cover my expenses and i had a 
 feeling of relief 
 i knew i had come to the level of income 
 my form could currently haunt 
 i wasn't ahead of myself in any way and 
 from then on 
 it was as if i came to earth and was 
 building from a solid foundation 
 at that moment i felt i was standing on 
 a strong base of trust in the 
 universe from then on i knew the amount 
 of money in my life 
 would keep expanding and i would never 
 go back to not having 
 after that happened there was an 
 increasing flow of money in 
 my life i moved to a new level of 
 business and finance that i had 
 never dealt with before i had become 
 really good at learning how 
 to follow the universe on one level but 
 the new challenge was learn 
 into trust at a more expanded level 
 where the stakes were higher 
 in confronting this new level of 
 prosperity i felt at first rather 
 ignorant and helpless i knew i needed 
 help 
 so i asked the universe to send me the 
 right people to teach and guide me in 
 this area 
 after interviewing a number of different 
 financial advisors 
 i was led to both an accountant and a 
 business manager to refer 
 fact for me and who helped me learn what 
 i needed to know 
 like most people i have found that as my 
 income expands 
 my expenses and responsibilities 
 seem to expand right along with it 
 interestingly enough 
 it seems to work in reverse as well i 
 always 
 seem to create exactly as much money as 
 i need to support the 
 lifestyle i have created sometimes 
 when i'm confronted with a large 
 unexpected expense 
 i wonder how it's going to get handled 
 one way 
 or another it always does often in 
 surprising and unexpected ways 
 it frequently seems as if some higher 
 power within me is 
 watching over me and making the whole 
 thing work my job is to 
 keep learning more on a practical level 
 about managing my bussy 
 nas and financial situation while 
 continuing to do my inner work 
 of learning not to push myself so hard 
 and how to relax 
 and receive more easily the more i bring 
 myself 
 into balance the more smoothly money 
 flows in my life 
 for more of my ideas and practical 
 techniques about money and prosperity

 the creating true prosperity 
 workbook here is a wonderful story that 
 illustrates the miraculous way 
 the universe works when we trust and 
 follow our intuition 
 in the original edition of living in the 
 light 
 i wrote about buying a piece of property 
 in hawaii because i had a strong 
 intuitive feeling that 
 it was the right thing to do logically 
 it did not make sense 
 and my financial advisors were not in 
 favor of it still 
 i went ahead because it felt right to me 
 one factor in this decision was the fact 
 that this beautiful land was about to be 
 bought by an unscrupulous 
 and exploitive developer at the time i 
 wrote the book 
 i wasn't quite sure what would happen 
 next 
 but felt very empowered by trusting 
 myself that much 
 subsequently i had many moments of 
 doubting that decision 
 i wanted to create a home and a retreat 
 center in hawaii 
 but i soon realized this piece of land 
 was not 
 large enough also this land was 
 on maui and i felt strongly that i 
 needed to be on kauai 
 i even to ali decided to sell this 
 property 
 it took quite some time before it was 
 sold 
 however and ultimately resulted in a 
 moderate finin 
 shell as for me since the sale was 
 handled by an agent 
 i didn't meet the purchasers of the 
 property 
 i chalked the whole thing up to a 
 learning experience and eventually 
 bought the property i real 
 lie wanted on cal i where i still live 
 a few years later my mother who lives on 
 maui 
 happened to meet the two men who had 
 bought my property 
 they told her this amazing story 
 they had been living in los angeles 
 working hard and longing 
 for a big change in their lives they 
 read my book creative 
 visualization and decided to move to 
 hawaii 
 they began visualize in the ideal 
 property they would like to find there 
 and gotta very vivid image and feeling 
 about it 
 they took a trip to maui and looked at 
 many pieces of prop 
 ready but none was right just as they 
 were about to leave 
 they went to see one last piece and it 
 was exactly as they imagined 
 someone else had put in an offer but 
 that offer fell through 
 and they were able to buy it only when 
 they signed the papers did they realize 
 that they were buying my property we 
 eventually became friends 
 they developed the property beautifully 
 creating a lovely flower farm in bed and 
 breakfast 
 and have lived there happily for many 
 years i now feel that i was 
 guided to buy that property in order to 
 make sure that it got to the 
 people who were meant to care for it i 
 may have lost some money 
 but i gained enormous satisfaction 
 meditation 
 sit or lie down in a position that is 
 comfortable for you 
 close your eyes and begin breathing in 
 an 
 easy natural way with each 
 breath you are becoming more deeply 
 relaxed 
 begin to notice how you're feeling how 
 do you feel emotion 
 ally how does your body feel notice the 
 energy in your body 
 what does it feel like see yourself 
 taking in more energy with 
 each breath you are energized and alive 
 start to imagine this energy as money as 
 you open to your 
 own energy you open to abundance imagine 
 having all the money you need to do the 
 things that 
 are most important to you and to create 
 a lifestyle that is inhere 
 money with your being and with the earth 
 exercise 
 lack of money may mirror the energy 
 blocks within you 
 write down all the ways in which you 
 limit your desires and 
 activity in what ways are you not doing 
 what you want to do 
 some examples of this are 1. 
 i'm doing administrative work in an 
 office when i'd rather 
 be working with children 2. i want to 
 meditate 
 but there's never time 3. i'd like to 
 explore my art more 
 but i have no time i have to earn a 
 living 
 4. i want to tell my mother friend 
 partner 
 how i'm feeling but i'm afraid i'll hurt 
 her 
 him now imagine yourself doing exactly 
 what you want to do in 
 each of these areas chapter 19 
 health our body is our primary creation 
 the vehicle we have chosen to express us 
 in the physical world 
 by looking at our bodies list tending to 
 them 
 and feeling them we can read a great 
 deal about 
 our spiritual mental and emotional 
 energy patterns 
 the body is our primary feedback 
 mechanism that can show us what is and 
 isn't 
 working about our way of thinking 
 expressing 
 and living any normal child who has had 
 a reasonably positive environ 
 mint has a beautiful lively body filled 
 with vitality 
 that beauty aliveness and vitality are 
 simply the natural energy of the 
 universe 
 flowing freely through unimpeded by 
 negative habits 
 small children in a supportive 
 environment are totally spontaneous 
 beings they eat when they are hungry 
 fall asleep when they are 
 tired and express exactly what they feel 
 therefore their energy doesn't get 
 blocked 
 and they are constantly renewed and 
 revitalized 
 by their own natural energy but because 
 none of us have had even a close to 
 perfect upbringing in 
 very early we begin to develop habits 
 that run counter to our 
 natural energy these habits are designed 
 to help us survive in the 
 neurotic world in which we find 
 ourselves we pick these patterns 
 up from our families friends teachers 
 and the community in gen 
 to all as we follow the behavior we have 
 observed in others 
 or as we attempt to follow the rules 
 laid down by others 
 we may move in ways that are counter to 
 our own natural flow 
 we stop acting on what we know 
 physically and emotionally 
 we no longer say and do what we really 
 feel 
 we stop listening to the signals our 
 body gives 
 us about the food rest exercise 
 and nurturing it needs it becomes 
 too risky to follow our own energy so we 
 block that flow 
 and gradually begin to experience less 
 and less 
 energy and vitality as 
 the energy flow diminishes the body is 
 not physically revitalized as 
 quickly thus it begins to age and 
 deteriorate 
 as we repeat it negative behaviors 
 our bodies begin to reflect these 
 patterns 
 such as hunching over to express the 
 inner pattern of making one 
 self small and powerless if you are 
 willing to allow the energy of the 
 universe to move 
 through you by trusting and following 
 your intuition you will 
 increase your sense of aliveness and 
 your body will reflect this 
 with increasing health beauty and 
 vitality 
 every time you don't trust yourself and 
 don't follow your inner truth 
 you decrease your aliveness and your 
 body will reflect this with a loss of 
 vitality 
 numbness pain and eventually physical 
 disease 
 disease is a message from our bodies 
 telling us that 
 in some way we are not following our 
 true energy or supporting our feel 
 inks the body gives us many such signals 
 starting with relatively subtle feelings 
 of tiredness and discomfort 
 if we don't pay attention to these cues 
 and make the appropriate changes 
 our bodies will give us stronger signals 
 including aches pains and minor ill 
 nesses if we still don't change a 
 serious or fatal illness or accident 
 may eventually occur the stronger 
 messages can 
 often be avoided by paying attention to 
 the subtler ones 
 but wants a strong message has come 
 it is never too late to be healed if 
 that is what we truly 
 desire at this point however 
 many beings do not choose the heel in 
 they decide to leave their bodies and 
 start over with a new one 
 or move to another realm rather than 
 trying to work their way 
 through all the old patterns in this one 
 if you are suffering from disease 
 rest your body always wants 
 rest and ease if it's sick then when 
 you've become quiet 
 ask your body what the message in your 
 illness is 
 your body will always attempt to tell 
 you what you need in order to heal 
 yourself 
 one of my friends had been having severe 
 pain on the right 
 side of her face intuitively she felt 
 the pain would use a sheet 
 open her mouth and state more of what 
 she wanted and more of 
 what she knew she did this and the pain 
 eased some 
 but it still wasn't gone one night 
 in a mood of surrender she told the uni 
 verse she was sick of the whole thing 
 and she asked for an answer 
 then she let go of thinking about the 
 problem and went to sleep 
 in her dreams that night her intuition 
 told her to stop taking 
 brewer's yeast she immediately 
 discounted the entire message as 
 bizarre and continued to take yeast then 
 a few days later 
 after continued potting from her 
 intuition 
 she stopped taking yeast two days later 
 her face pain cleared up when you ask 
 for a healing 
 you never know what your body is going 
 to tell you 
 it may tell you to stop or start eating 
 some 
 thing express some feelings to a friend 
 quit your job 
 or go see a doctor the key is to ask and 
 then listen for a response 
 a client came to me who had been 
 suffering from severe back 
 pain for a year and a half during the 
 session 
 i asked him to con tack the pain and ask 
 his body what it was trying to tell him 
 in doing this he realized he had not yet 
 grieved his mother's death or 
 expressed the anger he felt toward his 
 father he was holding both 
 anger and sadness in his back 
 recognizing this relieved some of 
 the pain after more talking he was able 
 to cry about his mother's 
 death shortly after this he became 
 willing to express his anger 
 toward his father he started by talking 
 to me about it 
 as well as writing out all his feelings 
 his back pain went away his back pain 
 has continued to be a barometer of 
 suppressed feelings 
 he knows now that if he's in pain he 
 needs to back himself up by express 
 in some feelings once we've developed a 
 symptom 
 it can recur if the behavior recurs 
 our bodies serve us by accurately 
 informing us of any 
 blocked energy below i've listed some 
 common causes

 or may not be accurate for you

 regularly 
 vision problems not wanting to look at 
 certain things within 
 yourself or in the world often there is 
 a decision early in life not 
 to look at what you are intuitively 
 seeing because it is too 
 painful when the inner vision is shut 
 down the external vision is 
 impaired as well i am now willing to see 
 everything in my life clearly 
 hearing problems needing to shut out 
 external voices and in flu 
 answers needing to listen more to your 
 inner voice 
 i don't have to listen to anyone else i 
 listen to 
 and trust my own inner voice 
 addiction the more uncomfortable we are 
 about trusting our natural 
 energy the more likely we are to use 
 drugs such as coffee 
 sega rats alcohol unwholesome foods or 
 too much food 
 marijuana speed cocaine 
 or whatever to attempt to manipulate our 
 energy 
 we thereby deplete and denigrate the 
 body further 
 most people are afraid of their energy 
 and power 
 they're either afraid of being too much 
 or too little 
 they're afraid of having too much energy 
 or not enough 
 the truth is if people would be willing 
 to let go of using addictive substances 
 they'd find their own perfect flow of 
 energy 
 by doing this they tap their true source 
 of power and creativity 
 i see addiction as a means people use to 
 pace control 
 this power many powerful and creative 
 people become addicts because 
 they do not have an internal strength to 
 support their energy 
 without a trust in the universe one's 
 power and creativity can seem 
 overwhelming with substances you can 
 force your natural energy 
 or you can dampen it but either way 
 you're stopping the natural 
 flow of the universe coming through you 
 don't have to be a full-blown addict to 
 realize you're using 
 a substance to manipulate your energy 
 you may realize you're 
 drinking three cups of coffee to 
 energize yourself then discover 
 you're depleted later we are a nation 
 addicted to coffee 
 which i consider a strong drug because 
 it seriously impairs your ability to 
 trust and follow your energy the key is 
 to notice what you're doing 
 become aware of when and why you use 
 coffee notice how it changes your energy 
 eventually you will find that you don't 
 need to pay that price any 
 more realize that we all use some form 
 of addiction to pace our 
 selves the cure for this is to build 
 trust in ourselves and the uni 
 verse become increasingly willing to 
 experience your own power 
 and strength this is the true healing 
 for those who have a drug or alcohol 
 addiction noticing that 
 you're pacing yourself is not enough it 
 may make you more aware 
 of your problem and how shut down you 
 are but generally the 
 physical craving takes over any 
 awareness because of this 
 i incur age people to get help and 
 support through a group such as 
 alcoholics anonymous or narcotics 
 anonymous to recover from 
 alcohol or drug addiction this gives the 
 body a chance to heal and 
 the spirit and emotions a chance to be 
 heard

 put your conscious 
 ness into that place and ask it what it

 body what you need to do 
 to heal yourself pay attention to and 
 follow 
 whatever it tells you chapter 20 
 yo you are p e r f e c t b o d y 
 having a beautiful body starts with 
 following the natural flow 
 of your energy trust yourself express 
 yourself physically in ways 
 that feel good sleep as much as you need 
 to 
 stay in bed if you feel you need more 
 rest 
 eat what your body truly desires and 
 fall 
 low your heart if you're willing to 
 trust your body 
 you'll learn what's best for you 
 it sounds simple enough the problem is 
 that we've been 
 taught to distrust our bodies and see 
 them as needing to be calm 
 trolled some religions even suggest that 
 the spirit is good and the 
 body is a weak sinful tool of the devil 
 although we have evolved to the point 
 where these beliefs are not generally 
 expressed openly 
 we still respond to our bodies with 
 mistrust as a culture 
 we're accustomed to ignoring our bodies 
 and their needs 
 our minds tell our bodies what to do 
 we decide that a nine-to-five workday 
 fall with 
 three meals a day is a reasonable way to 
 live 
 then we expect our bodies to cooperate 
 even if this doesn't feel good we've 
 also devil 
 hoped intellectually theories for what's 
 good for us and what isn't 
 what foods we should and shouldn't eat 
 as children 
 we usually adopt parental and societal 
 rules and 
 habits regarding food even if you want 
 to eat something else for 
 dinner or want to eat at a different 
 time your most likely expect 
 ed to conform to the norms of the system 
 the body can't tell you 
 one thing and society another many of us 
 learn to distrust 
 our selves at an early age this distrust 
 causes internal conflict and an 
 imbalance in our system it can set up a 
 lifelong battle between the 
 authoritarian and rebel voices within us 
 when we rebel 
 we may find ourselves craving all kinds 
 of things we would not normally 
 desire if left to our natural flow we 
 may develop the habit of going for the 
 quickest available high 
 our bodies may react to this imbalance 
 by gaining weight 
 becoming hyperkinetic losing weight 
 or developing food addictions and 
 allergies then 
 to solve these problems we may try 
 even harder to control ourselves by fall 
 lowering a rigid 
 restrictive diet this causes us to feel 
 deprived 
 so eventually the rebel takes over again 
 and brings on the very foods 
 we were trying to avoid we may play at 
 the same conflict in regard to physical 
 elixir 
 size many people believe the only way 
 they can keep their bodies 
 in shape is to push themselves to 
 exercise in a very driven way 
 we may resist this by becoming lethargic 
 and never exercising at 
 all our society fosters this struggle 
 and profits from it 
 we are constantly shown what a beautiful 
 body should look like 
 and are sold ways of getting there 
 we are soul diets miracle weight loss 
 plans low calorie or fat free foods and 
 health club memberships 
 we are constantly beating our bodies 
 into some new idea of health 
 and beauty the problem with the external 
 pictures and shouldes 
 we adapt from outside of ourselves is 
 that we are constantly dis 
 satisfied with the way we look or the 
 way we feel 
 the way to a healthy strong and 
 beautiful body is to learn to 
 trust and love yourself you can begin 
 this process by becoming 
 aware of all the rules and ideas you 
 have about how you should 
 look and feel what you should eat how 
 you should exercise 
 and so on it can help to write these 
 down 
 adding more to the list whenever you 
 become aware of another belief or rule 
 the process of writing down these ideas 
 can help you become less identified 
 with them so that you can begin to have 
 more choice about which 
 once if any you want to follow in the 
 process of doing this 
 you may discover more of your inner 
 primary selves 
 such as zipper perfectionist who has 
 very high ideals it wants you to live 
 up to the pusher who drives you to 
 accomplish the perfectionists goals 
 and the critic who constantly reminds 
 you of how you are failing 
 once you gain some awareness of these 
 ideas and energies 
 and are not so unconsciously controlled 
 by them you can begin to 
 ask yourself what you truly want and 
 tune into your own intuitive 
 feelings about what is really right for 
 you your own body and your intuition are 
 ultimately the best guides about what is 
 good for you and how to take care of 
 yourself 
 you may find that once you are paying 
 attention your body will 
 spontaneously let you know what it needs 
 to eat and how it wants 
 to move and exercise some people find 
 that just by following their 
 energy they develop their own personal 
 diet and exercise program 
 that is exactly what their body needs 
 and this may change from 
 time to time for example at certain 
 times 
 their body may want to exercise 
 vigorously 
 in which case it feels wonderfully 
 exhilarate 
 and satisfying at other times it may 
 want to rest 
 or exercise very gently 
 many people find that they need 
 additional information and 
 structure in which case their inner 
 guidance leads them to the 
 appropriate books nutritionist exercise 
 coach 
 doctor or teacher it is perfectly fine 
 and can be very helpful to follow 
 someone else's 
 diet or exercise program as long as it 
 feels right for you 
 the process of healing your relationship 
 to your body may 
 take some time and require some help and 
 support 
 our feelings about our bodies are 
 usually connected to very deep issues 
 related 
 to our self-esteem our identities our 
 families 
 our sexuality and so on 
 it can be helpful to have the support of 
 a therapist while 
 exploring these core issues if you have 
 chronic weight problems 
 food addictions oran eating disorder and 
 are not currently in therapy 
 i strongly recom men seeking help from a 
 therapist 
 support group or treatment program that 
 specializes in these issues 
 fortunately these days there are many 
 excellent programs and counselors in 
 this field 
 many people also find help in this area 
 through overreaders 
 anonymous one of the 12-step programs 
 which are free and available in most 
 cities 
 assertion one of the most important keys 
 to creating a healthy 
 beauty full body is learning to assert 
 yourself consistently in your life 
 i have found that many people with body 
 issues have a pattern of 
 doubting themselves of being afraid to 
 trust their feelings and act 
 on them they especially need to learn 
 how to say no to others 
 when they don't want to do something 
 many overweight people 
 i've worked with don't have strong 
 personal boundaries they try to 
 please and take care of others and allow 
 others to intrude on them 
 and take advantage of them thus they 
 need to use extra weight 
 as a buffer a way of creating some 
 distance from others 
 women in particular may fear that by 
 becoming slim 
 they will be too sexually attractive 
 they are afraid of attracting unwanted 
 attention or energy 
 and don't trust themselves to know how 
 to deal 
 with it some people are afraid of 
 feeling too sensitive and vulnerable 
 able and not knowing how to protect 
 themselves 
 others are afraid of being too spaced 
 out 
 they use their weight to ground them if 
 you have these fears 
 you can diet forever and you will not 
 lose 
 weight or keep it off because you are 
 unconsciously needing it 
 this is why the process of assertion is 
 so vital 
 when you learn to back up your feelings 
 with action 
 you create an internal strength and 
 protection 
 you feel safe to move into new 
 situations 
 and attract attention and energy knowing 
 that you will be able to 
 say no to anything that doesn't feel 
 good to you you know that 
 you will be true to yourself and take 
 good care of yourself 
 your female aspect feels safe and 
 supported 
 knowing that your inner male will back 
 her up 
 my experience has been that once people 
 learn assertion 
 they are able to lose weight more easily 
 and naturally without deprivation 
 the increased energy circulation in 
 their bodies dissolves the 
 blocked energy and the extra weight 
 gradually melts away 
 they know longer needed for strength or 
 protection 
 so they release it effort lastly 
 if any particular diet is needed they 
 are guided to the apro 
 pry eight nutritionist or diet plan or 
 they feel intuitively what they need to 
 be eating 
 and find it appropriate and enjoyable to 
 do so 
 waiting equals excess weight if you are 
 always waiting to be 
 do or have what you want your 
 energy gets blocked and your body may 
 reflect this in excess 
 weight by expressing yourself directly 
 and doing what you want 
 when you want asserting yourself energy 
 will move freely 
 through your body and this circulation 
 will dissolve excess weight 
 the more you're willing to be yourself 
 the less you'll need to use 
 food as a substitute nurturer you'll be 
 receiving the natural knower 
 touring of the universe the key to 
 self-assertion is to take action on your 
 feelings and 
 intuition i've seen people lose weight 
 simply by doing something 
 they've been afraid to do or by 
 expressing some feeling they've 
 suppressed by continuing to do this you 
 dissolve blocks and 
 your weight balances out 
 at first the prospect of asserting 
 yourself moment to moment 
 can be frightening we're not used to 
 stating what we need and tack 
 in action to give it to ourselves it 
 takes a conscious effort to tune 
 into how we feel and risk doing it once 
 you start doing 
 this though it feels so good that you'll 
 want to keep doing it 
 you'll lose weight have more energy 
 and look more alive and beautiful there 
 really is no turning back 
 the alternative is numbness and death 
 every time i follow my inner voice i 
 feel more life energy 
 flowing through me every time i go 
 against it 
 i can feel a stroke clean my body and a 
 heaviness and tiredness 
 if i continue to push myself past what 
 my body wants 
 i become increasingly tired and lifeless 
 one of my clients was about 80 pounds 
 overweight when 
 she started working with me she tried 
 every conceivable weight 
 loss program in an effort to lose weight 
 but had not successfully 
 solved her problem then as she learned 
 how to trust and take 
 care of herself she began to heal 
 herself by expressing her sup 
 breast feelings at a weekly support 
 group that i led 
 she was encouraged to express herself 
 directly 
 saying what she felt and what she wanted 
 she began to trust her body and started 
 eating 
 only what she really wanted she grew 
 physically and spiritually 
 lighter and after a few months she had 
 lost about 40 pounds 
 at this point she thought she'd gotten 
 all she needed from the 
 group and wanted to drop out even though 
 she was still carrying 
 a lot of excess weight i felt that she 
 was still holding back a lot of 
 feelings however so i encouraged her to 
 express what she was still 
 waiting to say she shared that three 
 members in the group had 
 started to bother her and she didn't 
 feel safe in sharing her feelings 
 with them they reminded her of people 
 and painful events from 
 her past in them she saw her husband 
 her son and herself mir roared 
 they reminded her of things she had not 
 said or done 
 they reminded her of self-betrayal 
 because of this she felt angry every 
 time she looked at them i encouraged her 
 to work with me privately on these 
 issues 
 and if she was willing to come back to 
 the group and express her 
 feel things with group members she 
 needed to say what she had not said 
 in the past she did do this because of 
 this 
 she began to heal her old emotional 
 wounds and forgive herself for the past 
 her energy is no longer tied to the past 
 so it can move more freely through her 
 body 
 she continued to lose weight without 
 overly restrictive 
 dieting pacing with food people use food 
 to pace their natural energy level 
 if you're a person who has too much 
 nervous energy 
 you may use it to slow yourself down 
 or if you feel a need for a pickup you 
 may use it for 
 that both ultimately lead to a partial 
 suppression of your true inner 
 g people are generally frightened of 
 their power and energy 
 so they feel the need to pace the degree 
 to which it flows through 
 them some people use food to do this 
 others use drugs alcohol relationships 
 work or various other addictions as 
 people become 
 more willing to experience and express 
 their natural energy 
 the need to use food or other substances 
 in this way will lessen 
 appreciating your body appreciate the 
 beauty in your body and in yourself 
 today focus on what you do like about 
 yourself 
 the more willing you are to do this the 
 easier it will become 
 your body will respond to this 
 appreciation and grow increasingly 
 beautiful 
 it's become a habit to see what needs to 
 be changed about 
 our selves we're waiting for perfection 
 before we'll love ourselves calm 
 plately you can change these 
 self-critical tapes by looking at what 
 you like about yourself and giving 
 yourself positive feedback 
 if you have trouble appreciating 
 yourself start by looking at 
 others who have the same qualities you 
 have and admire them 
 a friend of mine who considered herself 
 20 pounds over 
 weight was continually putting herself 
 down for the way she 
 looked she felt the only way she could 
 possibly like herself would 
 be if she were thin because she could 
 not see her own beauty 
 she thought she'd start by looking at 
 women who had a similar body 
 type and learned to appreciate them she 
 started to see how beauty 
 full other overweight women were in 
 noticed how sensual and 
 alive they looked she started 
 complimenting others on their looks 
 by doing this she could look at her own 
 body in a no way 
 she began to accept and appreciate 
 herself 
 her body responded to this approval with 
 more life and energy 
 she gradually lost a few pounds and has 
 continued to appreciate her body as it 
 is

 chapter 21 life and death 
 life is the choice to follow the flow of 
 energy within us 
 death is the choice to block or go 
 against this life energy 
 we are faced with this life or death 
 choice every moment of our lives 
 each time that we choose to trust and 
 follow our intuition 
 our channel opens more and more of the 
 life force flows through 
 the cells of our body actually receive 
 more energy and are renewed and 
 revitalized faster physically 
 emotionally 
 and mentally we feel more alive and more 
 of our spiritual light can shine through 
 our body stays young healthy 
 and beautiful and radiates vitality 
 when we choose not to follow our 
 intuitive promptings 
 we close off our channel and our cells 
 receive less energy 
 the body begins to deteriorate faster 
 when we aren't following the flow of 
 energy 
 life becomes a struggle stress and 
 strain take their toll on 
 the physical form and we can see the 
 struggle in our faces and bod 
 eyes lines of worry form and the body 
 begins to bend with the 
 effort it is making if we continue to 
 choose to close off the inner 
 do moment after moment day after day 
 year after year 
 eventually the body will age deteriorate 
 and die if we change our pattern and 
 begin to trust 
 ourselves more the body will begin to be 
 renewed a part of all of us wants life 
 wants to make the commitment to live and 
 is willing to trust our intuition and 
 follow it from 
 moment to moment there's also a part of 
 us that doesn't trust 
 ourselves i can't do this it's too much 
 too intense i don't want to surrender 
 when we go against ourselves we 
 experience only 
 effort and struggle when we surrender to 
 life 
 we feel passion aliveness and flow 
 anytime somebody dies they are 
 consciously or unconscious 
 lie choosing to leave this physical body 
 it may appear that they are 
 victims of a disaster or a deadly 
 disease but on a soul level 
 they are in charge of their own journey 
 their spirit knows what it's 
 doing although the personality may not 
 some souls come into 
 physical form to accomplish a specific 
 purpose and having a calm 
 blessed it they leave or failing to 
 accomplish it 
 they may decide to move on to another 
 realm 
 or perhaps come back to this one in 
 another life 
 some beings feel they've gotten stuck 
 and it's not 
 working they feel like they're not 
 learning fast enough 
 this life started with too many negative 
 odds against me 
 i don't want to deal with this anymore 
 i'd rather start over by consciously 
 making a choice for life 
 you influence the choice of those around 
 you 
 moment by moment if you choose to trust 
 your intuition and act on it 
 you're choosing aliveness rather than 
 death 
 and you're increasing the aliveness that 
 radiates 
 from you anybody who is connected with 
 you will feel this and it 
 will strengthen the choice they make to 
 live the more we choose to follow the 
 life force 
 the healthier end more vital our bodies 
 will become 
 by living as channels for the universe 
 it's possible to become more energetic 
 alive 
 and beauty full as we get older rather 
 than less so 
 we will no longer leave our bodies 
 unconsciously 
 through accident or illness we will stay 
 in 
 the physical body as long as we desire 
 and will make the conscious 
 choice to leave at whatever time we 
 desire to do something else 
 death when we choose it will not be a 
 tragedy but a conscious 
 transition into another realm meditation 
 sit or lie in a comfortable position 
 close your eyes 
 takes a roll deep breaths and relax your 
 body 
 with each breath let go of everything in 
 the way of being with yourself 
 slowly relax into that core place within 
 recall a recent situation where you 
 chose not to follow your 
 energy when you did not do what you 
 wanted to do 
 replay this scene in your mind 
 see yourself going against what you knew 
 to 
 be true for you then notice how you 
 looked and felt physically 
 mentally emotionally and spiritually 
 now go back to that same situation and 
 see yourself 
 doing exactly what you want to do 
 see yourself choosing to follow the 
 energy 
 then notice how your body feels notice 
 how you look and 
 feel about yourself spend a few minutes 
 feeling what it's like to 
 trust yourself and act on what you want 
 exercise 
 keep a journal of some of the decisions 
 you made during the 
 day notice when you did what you wanted 
 and when you choose 
 not to then write how you felt about the 
 choices you made 
 notice how you felt physically and 
 emotionally 
 as you become more aware of when you 
 follow your energy 
 when you go against it and the results 
 of each you'll increasingly 
 choose life and aliveness in each moment 
 chapter 22 transforming our world 
 transformation begins on an individual 
 level and moves out 
 into the world the more i'm learning to 
 trust my intuition and 
 act on it and the more i'm willing to 
 experience and accept all my 
 feelings the more the energy of the 
 universe can move through me 
 as it comes through it heals and 
 transforms me and everyone and 
 everything around me this is true for 
 each one of us 
 the more you are willing to trust and be 
 yourself 
 the more life energy will move through 
 you 
 everyone around you will benefit from 
 your energy and 
 begin to trust and be more themselves in 
 turn 
 they become pal are full channels for 
 everyone in their sphere of influence 
 and so transformation spreads rapidly 
 throughout the world 
 you may have heard of the hundredth 
 monkey syndrome 
 in japan in 1952 
 scientists were studying the behavior of 
 wild moan 
 keys the principal food of these monkeys 
 was sweet potatoes 
 one day they noticed one monkey do 
 something they had never 
 seen before she washed her potato before 
 she ate it 
 she repeat at this behavior on 
 subsequent days 
 and soon they noticed sever all other 
 monkeys washing their potatoes before 
 eating them 
 more and more monkeys began to do this 
 then in 1958 after almond 
 keys on the island were exhibiting this 
 new behavior 
 scientists on nearby islands began to 
 report that monkeys on their islands 
 were 
 also beginning to wash their potatoes 
 there was no physical con 
 connection between the islands and no 
 one had transported any moan 
 keys from one island to another this 
 study 
 illustrates something of overwhelmingly 
 powerful 
 importance for the human race and for 
 our planet 
 washing pota toes was a new level of 
 evolution for these monkeys 
 and when enough of them had accepted it 
 it was apparently transferred to the 
 monkeys on surrounding islands without 
 any physical contact 
 or direct communication this is how the 
 evolution 
 of consciousness takes place every 
 individual's consciousness is connected 
 to and is a part of 
 the mass consciousness when a small but 
 significant number of 
 individuals have moved into a new level 
 of awareness and significantly changed 
 their behavior 
 that change is felt in the entire mass 
 consciousness 
 every other individual is then moved in 
 the 
 direction of that change and the whole 
 thing may have started 
 with one individual who first made the 
 leap 
 so often we look at the world around us 
 and feel terribly help 
 less to affect any significant positive 
 change 
 the world seems so big and in such a 
 mess 
 and we feel so small and powerless the 
 100th monkey story helps us to see how 
 powerful one indie 
 vigil or a few individuals can be in 
 transforming the world 
 because the world truly is our mirror as 
 we change 
 it must change you can see this easily 
 in your personal life 
 as you devil up the habit of trusting 
 and taking care of yourself 
 you will grad ali release your old 
 patterns 
 soon you notice that your friends family 
 and business associates all seem to be 
 feeling and acting diff 
 friendly as well things that previously 
 frightened and upset you 
 seem to have lost their emotional charge 
 even the serious prob 
 limbs of the world while they still 
 concern you 
 may not seem quite as scary as before 
 the reason for this shift is that you 
 are beginning to feel the 
 power of the universe inside of you to 
 the degree that you expre 
 hence the presence of the universe in 
 your own body you don't feel 
 afraid of course every time you open up 
 to more power 
 more of the old fear gets flushed to the 
 surface and released 
 so in the heel in process will you 
 experience alternating states of power 
 and fear 
 gradually however a solid base of trust 
 will be established within 
 you others will feel this and in it will 
 find the support to open up 
 to more of their own power and truth the 
 people and things 
 around you will reflect you in 
 increasingly positive ways 
 the more light you allow within you the 
 brighter the world you live in will be 
 creating the change one idea i 
 frequently encounter 
 especially in groups of spiri to ali 
 oriented people 
 is that all we have to do to change the 
 world 
 is think more positively about it and 
 visualize the change we desire 
 visualization and affirmation are 
 powerful tools 
 i use them often and strongly recommend 
 them as part of this process 
 after all i wrote creative visualization 
 and i deeply believe in the 
 effectiveness 
 of the techniques it describes there is 
 another part of the 
 process that is frequently ignored 
 however yet it is just as emperor 
 stant if the world is our mirror then 
 whatever we see out there in 
 some way reflects what is in us we must 
 take responsibility for it 
 and be willing to transform it within 
 ourselves if we want to see it 
 change on the outside so when we look at 
 the world and see 
 poverty pain violence and chaos we must 
 be willing to say too 
 ourselves what is the poverty pain 
 violence 
 and chaos within me that this is 
 reflecting 
 i know that my world is my mirror and in 
 a sense 
 my creation if the things i see weren't 
 in me 
 they couldn't exist in the world 
 the trick here is not to take on blame 
 or guilt for the world's 
 problems none of us is truly responsible 
 for other people's lives 
 we were all co-creating this world 
 together and we are all doing the 
 best we know how we are here to learn 
 from what is not perfect 
 rather than blame ourselves for it we 
 need to adopt a positive addy 
 toot of responsibility saying i am 
 willing to learn to trust and fall 
 low my own inner truth knowing that as i 
 do i will release the pain 
 and fear within me and thus heal the 
 pain and fear in the world 
 such a vow is very powerful and to 
 follow through on it is no 
 easy task to do so we must be willing to 
 move through the deep 
 estate layers of our consciousness and 
 recognize not only our own 
 personal fears but also centuries-old 
 negative beliefs of humanity 
 that exist in our bodies to move through 
 these layers 
 we need to be willing to recognize and 
 experience all the fears 
 knowing that the light is healing and 
 dissolving them 
 when people ask me what they can do 
 about the problems of 
 the world i suggest that they start by 
 recognizing and affirming 
 that as they sincerely do their own 
 inner work the world is being 
 transformed i tell them to look at the 
 social problems that fright 
 in or disturb them and determine what 
 fear or pain it touches 
 within them and how it reflects their 
 personal situation 
 for example if they are disturbed by 
 reports of violence 
 i ask them to look at how violence has 
 played a part in their lives 
 has someone been violent toward them in 
 their early years 
 have they had violent thoughts and 
 feelings 
 have they repressed or decision cheated 
 from their own violent feelings 
 in what way have they done violence to 
 themselves internally 
 harshly criticizing themselves and so on 
 it has been my experience that many of 
 us need help 
 in the form of supportive therapy or 
 counseling 
 to deal with deep levels of emotional 
 healing 
 for some people there's a certain 
 reluctance 
 to seek such help perhaps because they 
 fear it's an indication of 
 sickness or craziness our culture tells 
 us that we should be total 
 lie self-sufficient and that needing 
 help is a sign of weakness 
 in reality we all need support at times 
 and it is a sign of strength too reach 
 out for appropriate help 
 personally i have sought therapy of 
 various types that many times in my life 
 and it has helped me great 
 lie as long as i trusted my own 
 intuition about who to work with 
 if you are deeply touched by the poverty 
 in which much of the 
 world's population is currently living 
 you may feel moved to make 
 some external gestures to help alleviate 
 someone's pain 
 that is con tribute some money 
 do some social or political work at the 
 same 
 time look within yourself to see in what 
 way you believe in 
 or support poverty or scarcity in your 
 own life 
 this may not be a question of money 
 you may be living in some form of 
 emotional or spiritual poverty while 
 surrounded by material luxury 
 or you may be at peace spiritually and 
 emotionally but holding on to 
 a belief that money is evil thus keeping 
 yourself in a state of 
 financial poverty poverty on both a 
 personal and worldwide 
 level is supported by our mass 
 consciousness belief in scarcity 
 we deeply fear that there is not enough 
 to go around of whatever we need 
 money food love energy 
 appreciation so we create a world that 
 supports 
 that belief there have been studies that 
 show that there is plenty 
 of food produced in this world to amply 
 feed everyone 
 yet because of our underlying belief in 
 poverty 
 we allow food to be thrown away in one 
 place while millions are starving to 
 death else 
 where if you are concerned by 
 environmental issues 
 consider this point of view mother 
 nature is symbolic of the nurturing 
 them innine aspect of ourselves 
 disrespect and lack of harmony with 
 nature are only possible in a society of 
 individuals who disrespect and disregard 
 their own feminine 
 intuitive nature if you are attuned to 
 your inner guidance 
 there is no way you can become severely 
 out of balance with your natural 
 environment 
 just as our bodies are the manifestation 
 of our consciousness 
 in physical form the earth is the 
 manifestation of our mask on 
 cisness in a sense the earth is our 
 collective body 
 the way we treat her mirrors the way we 
 treat our own bodies 
 the lack of respect and attunement 
 afforded to our bodies is 
 demonstrated on a global level by the 
 way we treat our earth 
 until we learn to love and trust our 
 bodies 
 to listen to their signals 2. give them 
 the food 
 rest and nurturing they need to stop 
 bullet 
 ink them with drugs and unwholesome food 
 and to stop trying to 
 control them with our ideas about what's 
 right i believe we will 
 continue to mistreat our earth body we 
 must be willing to recognize and heal 
 any form of io 
 lens poverty and imbalance within 
 ourselves as individuals if we 
 hope to eradicate these problems from 
 our world healing does 
 not take place on a personal or 
 planetary level as long as we hide 
 or deny our feelings all feelings 
 beliefs 
 and emotional patterns must be brought 
 to the light of consciousness in order 
 to be trans 
 formed when the light shines into the 
 darkness the darkness dis 
 appears world healing people frequently 
 talk about what terrible shape the world 
 is in 
 in many ways things seem to be going 
 from bad to worse 
 and this can be very frightening it has 
 helped me considerably to recognize 
 that the world is currently going 
 through a major healing crisis very 
 similar in form to what many individuals 
 are experiencing 
 when we as individuals begin to wake up 
 to the light 
 we also begin to become aware of the 
 darkness in which we have been live 
 in the patterns of living which formerly 
 seemed 
 normal begin to look crazier and crazier 
 from the perspective of our newly 
 acquired sanity fears and distortions 
 that have been denied and 
 ignored because they were too painful to 
 look at begin to come 
 into our consciousness in order to be 
 released problems that were 
 swept under the rug come forth to be 
 solved 
 this is what i see happening on a 
 worldwide level today 
 if we recognize the seeming chaos and 
 pain in the world as a giant man 
 infestation of our individual healing 
 process we can see that it's a 
 very positive step rather than feeling 
 like victims 
 we can recognize the power of the 
 universe at work 
 we can appreciate our selves as channels 
 through which the world's healing is 
 being 
 manifested social and political action 
 some who have heard these ideas become 
 angry because they 
 believe i am endorsing a narcissistic 
 self-absorption that denies the 
 problems of the world and negates the 
 necessity of social and 
 political action upon further discussion 
 i am usually though not always 
 able to make them understand that this 
 is not the case 
 being willing to deal internally and 
 individually with the original 
 source of the problem is simply the most 
 practical and powerful 
 for more of my thoughts on this topic 
 read the path of transformation 
 how healing ourselves can change the 
 world 
 way to effect real change it does not 
 deny the necessity of exter 
 now action on a large scale the issue 
 for me is the source and motivation for 
 that 
 action i find that people are frequently 
 moved by their own good ideas 
 more than by their inner guidance often 
 they are motivated by 
 their feelings of pain fear and guilt 
 into wanting to do something 
 to make it better they are coming from a 
 position of helpless 
 ness and fear struggling vainly to do 
 something to eradicate these 
 feelings unfortunately this approach 
 only perpetuates the prob 
 limit is trying to solve the underlying 
 cause of the world problems is the pain 
 fear and ignorance we experience from 
 being disconnected from the 
 power of the universe if we continue to 
 project our problems out 
 side of ourselves and fail to recognize 
 the inner power we actually 
 have i believe we will support the very 
 evils we are fighting 
 on the other hand if we are willing to 
 take responsibility for 
 our fears and deal with them we will 
 clear the way for being able 
 to hear the voice of the universe within 
 us if it tells us to take 
 action we can be sure the action will be 
 powerful and truly effective 
 for example a woman friend of mine 
 became very active in the 
 nuclear disarmament movement when she 
 talked about the issue 
 in her work it was obvious that she was 
 feeling absolutely terrified 
 of the possibility of nuclear war this 
 is actually a reasonable reconciliation 
 given the world situation the problem as 
 i saw it 
 was that she was not recognizing her own 
 terror and the issues of powerless 
 ness and death that she was struggling 
 with internally 
 so her actions and words had a frantic 
 quality 
 almost like a drowning person clutching 
 vainly for something to hold on to 
 gradually over several of years i saw 
 her work through this phase 
 of her process i believe that she 
 reached a deeper level of trust in 
 the universe she continued her 
 anti-nuclear activity because it was 
 something she deeply believed in and 
 found great satisfaction in 
 doing so but the energy was quite 
 different 
 there was power and strength in her 
 involvement 
 which i'm certain made her more 
 effective in her work 
 the same principles hold true in the 
 social and political arena 
 as in every other area of life if you 
 are doing what you think you 
 should do if you are motivated primarily 
 by fear and guilt 
 then no matter how good your actions 
 you are probably not being as effective 
 as you'd like to be 
 and you may even be hindering more then 
 you are helping 
 on the other hand if you are trusting 
 your intuition and fall 
 lowering your heart going where your 
 energy takes you and doing 
 what you really want to do you will see 
 that everything you do 
 has a positive effect in changing the 
 world you will be able to wreck 
 organize the transformational nature of 
 your actions 
 for many this will include direct social 
 and political action 
 and you'll be doing it because you love 
 it 
 people around you will also be affected 
 by 
 your energy and vitality even more than 
 they are affected by your 
 words and actions for now my inner 
 guidance had told me that living my life 
 as 
 i do writing books leading workshops 
 exploring my creativity tai 
 being myself is what i personally need 
 to be doing to effect 
 maximum change in my life and the world 
 i've also gotten a strong 
 feeling that i may someday be actively 
 involved in politics 
 as i was earlier in my life perhaps even 
 occupy a political office of 
 some sort although i have no particular 
 desire to do this at this 
 time i know that if that's what i'm 
 meant to do i'll find it in 
 exciting adventure i'm curious to see 
 what the universe has in store 
 for me the media i was once informed by 
 my inner guidance that television 
 would be the savior of the world i 
 resisted this idea because i 
 am not a tv buff i did recognize 
 however that is mindless and diddy attic 
 as much television programming may 
 appear at this time 
 telly vision is obviously an 
 extraordinarily powerful tool for 
 reaching 
 millions of people instantaneously i 
 think it is no accident that it 
 has been developed at this time and is 
 to be found in most homes 
 in the world although currently 
 controlled primarily by people whose con 
 cisness is thoroughly embedded in the 
 old world there are 
 even now occasional flashes of awareness 
 it is only a matter of time until new 
 world consciousness begins to penetrate 
 television pro 
 gramming in a regular and significant 
 way television is undoubtedly a major 
 educational tool 
 with the universe in charge it can 
 literally become a channel 
 it could pro a network for 
 instantaneously reaching a majority of 
 the 
 world population with conscious and 
 creative new ideas 
 can you imagine housewives watching soap 
 operas in which 
 people go through all the usual human 
 dramas but instead of the 
 typical doom and despair there is an 
 attitude of learning 
 and growing through life's changes 
 it could be highly entertaining with all 
 the usual sex and romance 
 birth and death drugs and diss ease 
 marriage and divorce but the characters 
 could be seen to use 
 their trials and tribulations in a 
 positive way to evolve in khan 
 cisness just as we are learning to do 
 once the housewives get 
 it it's certain that children and 
 husbands will get it in short order 
 it's obvious that the power of the media 
 movies 
 radio newspapers magazines 
 and books as well as television is 
 unmatched in its potential for fast 
 positive change rinse our mass 
 consciousness is ready for that shift a 
 five-step process for 
 personal and planetary healing 1. 
 affirm to yourself the power of the 
 universe is healing and 
 transforming me as i am healed and 
 transformed 
 the whole world is healed and 
 transformed 
 2. notice the social political and 
 environmental issues around 
 you pay particular attention to those 
 that trigger the most emotional reaction 
 in you 
 ask to see how they may reflect your bur 
 sonal issues 
 fears beliefs and patterns you may not 
 immediately 
 see any connection but stay open to 
 receiving this 
 information through your intuitive 
 channel 
 3. ask for the higher power of the 
 universe to release and heal 
 the ignorance fear and limitation within 
 you and in the world 
 be open to any inner guidance you may 
 receive to seek support in your 
 healing process through a counselor or 
 therapist friends 
 a work shop or group or in any other 
 form 
 4. regularly visualize your life and the 
 world as you would like 
 them to be see the meditation at the end 
 of this chapter 5. 
 ask your inner guidance to let you know 
 clearly if there is 
 any specific action you need to take 
 toward your own or 
 the world's healing then 
 continue to trust and follow your 
 intuition 
 knowing that you will be led to do 
 whatever is necessary 
 meditation sit or lie in a comfortable 
 position 
 take a few deep breaths and relax your 
 body 
 feel yourself dropping into a deep quiet 
 place within feel yourself contacting 
 that place of power and 
 activity your source of strength from 
 this source of strength 
 project yourself into the future a few 
 years or more 
 and in this projection imagine your life 
 exact 
 lie the way you want it to be start by 
 noticing how you feel spiritually and 
 emotionally 
 feel the strength and power within you 
 you trust your intuition and act on your 
 inner guidance 
 because of this your life is unfolding 
 in a wonderful way get a sense of your 
 body 
 how do you look and feel physical lie

 spirit strong 
 cora jess beautiful filled with life and 
 energy 
 experience what that feels like 
 how do you take care of your body what 
 do you eat

 people love and nurture you if you have 
 or want to 
 have a special partner in your life 
 imagine that relationship is you 
 would like it to be now remember that 
 the world is your mirror 
 as you are growing and changing so is 
 the world around you 
 in fact you are part of the mass 
 consciousness that is creating the world 
 so let yourself imagine the world 
 healing and transforming 
 coming into balance wholeness 
 and harmony just as you are chapter 23 
 a vision from the window of my apartment 
 i look across the sand francisco bay at 
 the beautiful city of san francisco 
 the light on the water and on the city 
 skyline is constantly changing 
 sometimes it is cloudy and misty 
 sometimes bright and shining but it 
 always 
 looks mystical perhaps this view 
 inspired an image that i frequent 
 well i have i see an ancient city gray 
 and decaying 
 it is literally descending grating the 
 old structure's crumbling into piles of 
 rubble 
 but it is being pushed aside because in 
 its place 
 a beautiful new city is a reese ing 
 this new city is magical it seems to 
 shimmer delicately 
 with every color in the universe i know 
 that it is being built inside 
 of us it is created from the light
