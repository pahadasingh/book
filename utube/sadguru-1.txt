Transcript for [DAILY STEPS To Manifest What You REALLY WANT | Sadhguru & Lewis Howes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHlGLlAf9HA)

 
 do not think in terms of abundance 
 think in terms of a fulfillment of life 
 yeah if you are a fulfilled life 
 according to your competence according 
 to your capability according to the 
 times in which you live nothing makes 
 you better the only thing is 
 [Music] 
 when 
 people are in a relationship 
 and there seems to be a wave 24.
 of joy and love and acceptance and then 
 other days maybe it's anger or 
 resentment or frustration 
 how do we how do we 
 move out of that and more into 
 acceptance 
 and 
 conscious love as opposed to 
 control or manipulation or will you need 
 to do this to make me happy how do we 
 expand beyond that 
 see first of all you must decide 
 is your life in pursuit of happiness or 
 is it an expression of joy 
 is it in the pursuit of happiness or 
 expression of joy 
 tell me in your life 
 when you're expressing your joy was that 
 the best moment or when you're pursuing 66.
 happiness what the best moment the joy 
 yes 
 so why is it that you have not done that 71.
 because you still believe there is joy 
 in this tree and you can squeeze it out 
 there is joy in this man or woman that 
 you can squeeze it out you bring them 
 and then you expect relation to be great 
 it will not be you bringing them out so 
 the jews of joy will come to you or love 
 will come to you 
 no 
 love is not something that you do 
 love is something that you can become 
 it's your quality 
 if your mind is 
 in a certain way it's joyful 
 if your emotions are in a certain way 
 it's loving 
 this is the quality of sweetness of body 
 if your body becomes sweet and pleasant 
 it's called health and pleasure 
 if your mind becomes very pleasant it's 
 called peacefulness and joyfulness if 
 your emotions become pleasant it's 
 called love and compassion if your 
 very life energy becomes 
 pleasant 
 it is called blissfulness and ecstasy 
 only if your surroundings become 
 pleasant it's called success 
 only to achieve success 
 you need competence you need cooperation 
 you need help from other people all 
 right because without all of them 
 cooperating there will be no success 
 right now these guys uh must cooperate 
 otherwise this shoot is not going to go 
 well yeah all right 
 but 
 even if these guys don't shoot well we 
 can still be joyful they cannot stop us 
 no we cannot we can be joyful yeah yes 
 they cannot stop us 
 but for the shoot to go well you they 
 need to cooperate if they don't 
 cooperate the situation will not go well 
 right for the success of this situation 
 you need the cooperation of all these 
 people 
 but for my body for my mind for my 
 emotion and my energies to feel pleasant 
 i don't need anybody's cooperation this 
 is 100 my business 
 so right now to experience love within 
 you you're asking somebody to be in a 
 certain way 
 oh all the best 
 you're going to have a trip 
 is that why you think uh most marriages 
 get go through divorce because it's more 
 of needing the other person to 
 support you and feeling a certain way 
 see 
 [Laughter] 
 suppose you 
 cannot walk without a crutch 
 without a crutch you cannot walk right 
 then next moment you go to go and say to 218.
 somebody some pretty woman 220.
 i cannot live without you 
 between the crutch and her what is the 
 difference i'm asking 
 one is a physical crutch another 
 emotional and psychological scratch 
 isn't it yeah so essentially you have 236.
 crippled yourself 
 this life is a complete life by itself 
 if this is a complete life it's joyful 
 loving wonderful by its own nature 
 now when it's feeling so wonderful it 
 may want to share this wonderfulness 
 with 
 people around 
 you can share with this with thousands 
 of people 
 but 
 you also want a more intimate sharing to 
 happen for that you need one person 
 so if it's about you expressing your joy 
 and love to somebody and you find that 
 person you think that person is going to 
 run away from you 
 well no you want to squeeze them for 
 love and joy 
 initially they drip afterwards sometimes 
 they're dry yeah 
 it's going to squeeze them too much yeah 
 for 
 the people watching or listening who 
 might be saying you know what 
 i've struggled in my relationships 
 i i don't have financial abundance i'm 
 struggling financially 
 out of shape struggling in my my health 
 and wellness 
 and they're wondering 303.
 how they can 
 use karma in a sense to support them to 
 create more abundance financial 
 abundance 
 spiritual abundance relationship 
 abundance health and well-being 
 or maybe they've been thinking well 
 maybe uh karma's been against me and 
 that that way of thinking 
 how can they start to think differently 
 to to apply 
 these principles you're setting up all 
 the wrong goals 
 what should the goals be 
 simply this 
 see right now if you instead of 
 philosophizing reading scriptures 
 reading self-help books all this just 
 pay attention to the trees around here 
 what are they doing 
 being be no no no no they have no 
 capability to be 
 they're not called beings only you call 
 being human being you are they are not 357.
 that's just a tree it's a wonderful tree 
 what is it doing beneath the ground it's 
 fighting all right 
 what is it fighting for is this 
 maple tree trying to produce apples 
 no no 
 it is just trying to be the best 
 possible maple tree it can be 
 it is not trying to produce apples 
 definitely i don't see any coconuts up 
 there 
 all right right 
 this is all as a human being you must 
 see how this life can blossom into its 
 fullest if it blossom to its fullest 
 somebody may become rich 
 with money for somebody may become 
 intelligent somebody may become 399.
 knowledgeable somebody may become loving 
 somebody may become an artist somebody 
 may just wonder 
 but 
 a fully blossomed human being is a joy 
 to see no matter what the hell they're 
 doing or what they're not doing 
 whichever way they're an asset to whole 
 humanity 
 instead of doing that 
 you want for example you said abundance 
 in uh economic terms what is your idea 
 of abundance in economic terms jeff 
 bezos is it 
 me personally that's not it but you mean 
 having enough to be able to do what you 
 want not feeling like you're a slave to 
 paying your bills no i'm not insulting 
 anybody i'm just saying right now 
 everybody's saying is the richest man in 
 the world or whatever so what is your 
 idea of abundance 200 billion dollars of 
 personal wealth 
 i'm asking are you up to it 448.
 the 200 billion for me yeah yeah why not 
 uh that's not my definition of abundance 
 but that is what is it 
 um 
 probably i mean 
 probably over a 
 i guess it depends on what age i am 
 telling me 
 10 years old is like a hundred thousand 
 dollars i'm rich you know uh my present 
 i mean 
 i feel pretty abundant financially but i 
 mean 
 if they're you're asking for a specific 
 number no no i'm asking for a number not 
 because i want to find out your number 
 yeah i'm asking because these numbers 
 are bloody meaningless 
 they're all socially relevant not 490.
 relevant to you and anyway talking about 
 karna right now let's say you are the 
 guy who has 200 billion dollars yes it's 
 only in your memory if i erase your 
 memory 
 your money is gone 
 hello yeah 
 it's gone isn't it well it's in your 506.
 bank account it is in the account but if 
 you if you forgotten what yeah if you've 
 forgotten the code or you've gotten the 
 access there's a whole lot of people 
 buried there treasured all over the 
 bloody world and somebody else found it 
 thousand years later that's true a lot 
 of people have lost all their bitcoin 
 and they can't get access to it yeah 522.
 yeah so 
 all these issues are there but the 
 important thing is 
 why do you want 
 affluence let me put the word abundance 
 as affluence okay an individual person 
 wants affluence 
 a society wants affluence a nation wants 
 affluence everybody is striving for that 
 why 
 because initially it means a choice of 
 nourishment 
 a choice of nourishment yes if you have 
 money you can eat what you want 
 initially that's the goal yes 
 if it goes beyond that after you eat 554.
 everything you want to eat next thing is 
 a choice of lifestyle yes 
 now for example united states of america 
 has the highest choice of nourishment 
 choices 
 highest level of nourishment choices 
 highest level of lifestyle choices all 
 right 
 but you're spending 3.25 trillion on 
 health care right 
 oh wonderful that's big that is larger 
 than india's economy 
 really for 1.4 billion people we don't 
 have a 3.3 under quarter trillion dollar 
 economy all right 
 so what is the abundance you're seeking 
 you you want to destroy the planet 
 that's what you're saying 
 i'm not saying for me i'm saying for 
 people watching it yeah no no i'm saying 
 this the thing that you're thinking is 
 because you're in california your idea 
 of abundance is here 
 if you are in timbuktu right your idea 
 of abundance would be this all right of 
 course so i'm saying do not think in 
 terms of abundance think in terms of a 
 fulfillment of life 
 if you are a fulfilled life according to 
 your competence according to your 
 capability according to the times in 
 which you live you will do the 
 appropriate thing 
 right now in the in pursuit of abundance 
 people are doing vulgar things 
 two people are living in a 
 50 bedroom 
 house what's the point of this right 
 you can you sleep in 50 different places 
 yeah you can have everything that you 
 can use well 
 but 
 the important thing is are you making 
 arrangements of home automobile this 
 that everything 
 as a means to act in the world 
 or as a means to enhance yourself this 
 you must decide this why i said the car 
 advertisements are all talking about the 
 leather about the paneling about this 
 why 671.
 because this is a way of enhancing 
 yourself your car is little shinier than 
 your neighbor's car and you're supposed 
 to be better i'm saying nothing makes 
 you better all right 
 nothing makes you better the only thing 
 is 
 everything that you can be within 
 yourself are you or are you not that's 
 all in our lives if we do not do what we 
 cannot do there is no issue if we do not 
 do what we can do we are a disaster 
 so i am saying at least are you as 
 joyful as you were when you were five 
 years of age 
 at 35 40 if you are not as joyful and as 
 exuberant as a five-year-old boy or girl 
 that you were 
 obviously you're a disaster because 
 you're not even square one 
 that was square one of your life when 
 nothing was in your control all right 
 you're not even in square one you sum 
 deeper that's a disastrous life 
 so we shouldn't be thinking abundance 
 and finance are there no those things 
 will happen according to times isn't it 
 yeah see if you and me were here 10 000 
 years ago 
 i would definitely find an indian cave 
 because there are many i don't know if 
 you would have found one ohio has case 
 yes it does yeah you wouldn't have come 
 to california you would have found a big 
 cave in ohio i've gone to neighboring 
 state of kentucky and found a really 
 massive cave out there all right 
 i've been visiting all these caves yeah 
 so 
 try to find some water what would be 
 your idea of abundance at that time i'm 
 asking 
 yeah 
 uh 
 so i'm saying so not to think of 
 abundance because the moment you thought 
 like that that is what destroyed this 
 planet 
 massively and now you are saying you 
 want to be eco-friendly by driving an 
 electric car 
 no no it is because fundamentally wrong 
 thinking has come life has become about 
 something else 
 something else around you enhances you 
 no 
 the only way to enhance yourself is to 
 bring this to its full blossoming of 
 what it can be at its fullest best what 
 it can be 
 what i am at my fullest am i better than 
 you no i'm just different this tree is 
 it better than that tree no this is one 
 way that's another way and that's why 
 the world is so beautiful 
 if there was one more guy just like you 
 in your house could you live there no no 
 if there were seven billion people just 
 like you could you live in this world 
 you would commit suicide believe me 
 so how does someone know what their full 
 potential is of who they can truly be 
 see if you don't fix yourself with 
 limited identities 
 if you do not compare yourself with 
 anything if you explore and not see if 
 you want this tree to grow to its 
 fullest thing that's why i said not the 
 fruit root 
 if you count the fruits maybe that tree 
 is bearing more fruit than this one 
 that's not the point 
 you nurture the root 
 the fullest possible nurture if you give 
 to the root what it has to become it'll 
 become a blade of grass cannot become a 
 tree 
 but is it not wonderful yeah 
 is it not wonderful you may step on it 
 yes but is it not wonderful yeah 
 you mostly have the garden for grass not 
 for trees actually 
 right 
 so how do we nurture our our inner roots 
 and not focus on the fruit see as there 
 is a science and technology 
 to create the situations that we want in 
 external situations there is a whole 
 science and technology to create inner 
 situations the way we want 
 if you want to be nurtured the first and 
 foremost thing is just look back and see 
 has there been 124 hours in your life or 
 many people that you know in your life 
 124 hours that they passed without 
 anxiety without fear without being 
 agitated nothing simply at least 
 24 hours 24 hours if you come to ease 
 believe me your ability to use your mind 
 and body 
 may go up 100 
 yeah in 24 hours 
 just ease 
 this does not come to people they're not 
 even at ease people ask me sadhguru how 
 are you like this 
 i say i'm like uh i'm talking to a crowd 
 of hundred thousand the way i would talk 
 to 
 somebody they came and asked me 
 something i'm in the bathroom i have to 
 peep out of that and speak just like 
 that i'm speaking to hundred thousand 
 people on stage with the same ease and 
 with the same 
 not being concerned about what somebody 
 thinks about me what happens that's not 
 the point what i see is truth i speak 
 you like it you don't like it you 
 realize it you don't realize it 
 that's left to you 
 but you will get it someday if you if 
 you heard the words not today maybe on 
 your death but you will get it but 
 that's a wasted time if you get it today 
 it would be wonderful today if you 
 understood sitting here 
 this body is just a piece of the planet 
 that i've picked up this is not really 
 me 
 it's for me to use it right now it's 
 wonderful okay this human body is the 
 finest mechanism on the planet 
 it's given to me as a gift i must keep 
 it well but 
 it's not me it's something that i 983.
 picked it up from the planet 
 if i understand this now 
 i will live a very sensible life 
 if you get it 991.
 from the maggots 
 what to do some realization happened at 
 least for the maggots yeah it's good 
 yeah 
 do you have any personal fears 
 what do you mean by that 
 do you have any fears of anything in 
 your life are you afraid 
 do you remember the last time you had 1011.
 fear 
 how old were you 
 i know fear only from other people's 
 experiences 
 see 
 it's not about whether i have fear or 
 not i made myself like this 
 only what i want happens within me 
 what i want may not always happen around 
 me 
 but within me only what i want happens 
 because this is my space it must happen 
 my way 
 why should it happen your way or 
 somebody else's way the same goes for 
 you isn't it yeah 
 what is within you must happen hundred 
 percent your way 
 no other way when you see 
 chaos around you in whatever way that 
 might be well i see it all the time how 
 does your what's your initial response 
 inside to 
 whatever someone screaming at you or 
 something unjust or some pain happening 
 around you or whether it's attacking you 
 or not 
 how do you internally respond or what do 
 you say 
 or what's your come from in that moment 
 to stay grounded to stay peaceful 
 joyful in a moment of pain 
 i will act as it's needed 
 that's 
 all yeah i will not do anything other 
 than that 
 if it needs action i'll perform that 
 action if it's not necessary yeah i'll 
 walk away from that it depends what kind 
 of situation it is yeah and i'm facing 
 such things all the time 
 you know all the time yeah 
 don't think i'm always celebrated there 
 are millions of people who celebrate me 
 as a very in a very fond manner 
 that i am very dear to them though they 
 have not seen me they're also quite a 
 number of people who simply hate me 
 endemic hatred towards me though they 
 have not seen me 
 simply because they're all invested in 
 something 
 if you something whatever it is they 
 call it nationality they call it 
 religion they call it caste creed race 
 whatever 
 the moment you say something that 
 threatens that identity 
 they will hate you 
 what is hate 
 saying about the person who's hating 
 something 
 it empowers them 
 it empowers them yes 
 hate 
 is far more empowering in terms of 
 propelling you into action than love 
 when people are loving they hesitate 
 they hesitate 
 but when they hate somebody they go all 
 out 
 what does the hate do to someone 
 who's 
 creating the hate 
 a little acid 
 but you know california acid is popular 
 right 
 and do you have any 
 big dreams do you think about your 
 dreams in the future or is it more just 
 you're here in this moment you're here 
 to show up 
 the most joyful way you can 
 no 
 see this whole thing about being in the 
 moment is just a mixed up idea 
 see what this means is right now the way 
 it is understood 
 in in this part of the world the way 
 it's understood is 
 being in the moment means don't think 
 about the past don't think about the 
 future 
 essentially they're saying do not use 
 your cerebral capability 
 a human being is endowed with a 
 phenomenal cerebral capability which no 
 other creature on this planet has in 
 that department we are number one on the 
 planet isn't it yeah 
 so right now because people do not know 
 how to use it and they're torturing 
 themselves with their several capability 
 they're poking themselves with their 
 sharp intellect 
 because of that somebody is saying don't 
 think about the past don't think about 
 the future just be in this moment if 
 you're drinking water just drink water 
 if you're talking just talk don't do 1239.
 anything 
 if this is just saying why don't you 
 become an amoeba once again 
 also has a brain small brain that's all 
 no problems amiba need not pray amiba 
 need not meditate amigo need not think 
 how to be peaceful very peaceful and 
 fine all right so even now for the human 
 beings if you remove half their brain 
 they will all be peaceful 
 essentially their problem is they don't 
 know how to handle their own 
 intelligence 
 so either you come up with philosophies 
 like this or you soak your brains half 
 in alcohol or drug it right do something 
 eat too much so that it won't work 
 all you're trying to do is somehow dull 
 the brain 
 i'm saying 
 this evolutionary process took millions 
 of years to give you this cerebral 
 capability and now you don't know how to 
 handle it how sad is that 
 that's a miserable thing that you're 
 doing because 
 no other creature 
 has the cerebral capability that human 
 being has 
 so essentially we are thinking 
 intelligence is a curse 1310.
 i told you already it's a curse if you 
 have limited 
 identity intelligence is a curse not 
 just for you for everybody around you 1320.
 see 
 somebody who is very sharp 
 but evil thoughts and they're doing 
 things you wish she was brainless 
 yes 
 so this is simply because of this you 
 don't know how to handle your 
 intelligence for well-being in you tell 
 me in your experience is intelligence a 
 solution or a problem 
 it depends on how it's being used no no 
 that's not the point is intelligence a 
 solution or a problem 
 essentially 
 i feel like it's a solution it is an 
 absolute solution 
 but people are making a problem out of a 
 solution right 
 right now people are making a huge 
 problem out of a 
 solution you think we evolve like this 
 to create problems 
 we evolve like this to sort out 
 everything right that other creatures 
 cannot start off right isn't it right 
 but we are not able to sort out anything 
 simply because we're crippling ourselves 
 with this kind of things so the most 
 important thing is you have an 
 intelligence for you don't have a stable 
 enough platform that is a fundamental 
 problem if you do not create a stable 
 chemistry stable energy system stable 
 physical body 
 your intelligence is the worst curse you 
 have right the sharper it is the more 
 you will hurt yourself 
 so this is your inability to handle it 1403.
 for this there are various reasons 
 because people are being raised like 
 cattle 
 all right not nurtured not nurtured 
 adults as you know get caught up in a 
 lot of things that aren't their true 
 nature and why is that why is that do 
 you think that we forget how to play and 
 think like a child when we grow up 
 so yeah 
 people have forgotten that 
 in this vast cosmos where we don't know 
 where is the beginning where is the end 
 in the middle of nowhere on a tiny 
 little mud ball called earth 
 you and me are sitting long distance and 
 talking right now okay 
 so 
 and 
 for the kind of creatures we are we are 
 not even a speck of dust in this 
 universe 
 but we have an individual experience 
 this is the magnanimity of creation that 
 it's given as an individual experience 
 though we are nothing tomorrow if the 
 whole humanity evaporates nobody will 
 message in this cosmos that's how small 
 we are 
 but 
 we have an individual experience 
 so this individual experience human 
 beings have taken it rather too 
 seriously as if they are the beginning 
 and end of the world the center of the 
 world yeah yes they thought they are the 
 center of the universe 
 so this misunderstanding 
 makes them 1489.
 believe as they grow up or as they 
 degenerate i would say they don't really 
 grow up because at the age of five if 
 you're so joyful and energetic by the 
 time you're 30 you should be ecstatic 
 and bursting 
 but if the reverse has happened this is 
 degeneration of life 
 so this degeneration happens because 
 people take their individual existence 
 rather too seriously they don't 
 understand before you and me came here 
 countless number of people who thought 
 they were smart and they were strong and 
 they were beautiful and they were 
 wonderful they are all topsoil now 
 countless number of people and you and 
 me also will be one day unless our 
 friends to our friends choose to bury us 
 really deep fearing that we may raise 
 from the dead or something 
 [Laughter] 1536.
 so 
 we have taken our individual existence 
 too seriously because of this 
 life has taken a back seat 
 our physical structure has taken front 
 seat our psychological structures have 
 you know gone to the stratosphere but 
 the life that we are is somewhere which 
 is not even in most people's experience 
 so this is the whole problem when you 
 were a child you were just a piece of 
 life slowly you took your personality so 
 seriously you took your boundaries of 
 your form so seriously that you think 
 this is it 
 so till death knocks on their door they 
 don't realize that this is not it 
 and and 
 you know i've i've learned that in some 
 cultures they focus on death multiple 1582.
 times a day to bring them back to that 
 moment of this is the only time we have 
 make the most of this moment don't take 
 things too seriously do you focus on 
 death a lot throughout your days or is 
 that not something you think about 
 live death all the time 
 you're on a motorcycle 
 [Laughter] 
 not just that motorcycle i live 
 yeah 
 just now if you do not know this i just 
 released a book on death 
 really 
 do you know this yeah it's a bestseller 
 in india right now wow so is it here in 
 the usa yet i gotta get a copy 
 we will send you a copy but it's not 
 released in usa 
 it's only released in by penguin india 
 because usa we are releasing another 
 book so this has been stalled 
 in u.s we are releasing a book on karma 
 it's perfect 
 [Laughter] 
 so the book is about 
 it is only for those who shall die 
 that's how it is titled death 
 a book for only those who shall die 
 because most people think other people 
 die 
 they don't realize we die 
 they do not see death essentially means 
 it reminds us that we have a limited 
 amount of time and energy to live 1660.
 nobody has unlimited time or unlimited 
 energy 
 if one is constantly conscious of this 
 definitely they will organize their life 
 and their prioritize their life in much 
 better way than the way they're doing it 
 right now 
 this is a fundamental death does not 
 mean something else not some terrible 
 thing 
 death simply means it is clearly 
 reminding you you have a limited lease 
 of time and energy that means you need 1687.
 to organize your time and energy to what 1689.
 is most valuable for you 
 not do one more thing that is not 
 necessary for yourself or anybody around 
 you 
 and 1697.
 because people think they are forever 
 they're in some restlessness all the 
 time i think they just put up a poem 
 which i wrote three four days ago it's 
 called life 
 the most restless ones rest so well 
 when life is taken out of them as if the 1714.
 only curse was life 
 what does that mean to rest so well you 
 mean sleep so well or live so well that 
 you feel restless oh even in sleep 
 they're rolling all over the place huh 
 they're not sleeping well no no 
 they need to either drink or pop a pill 
 to sleep most of them 
 so how do we get to a restful p place is 
 it is it more about our thoughts is it 
 more about our our heart our soul our 
 karma 
 our our physical body what's the place 
 to start for rest 
 see 
 [Applause] 
 right now people 
 generally people's understanding is rest 
 means sleep 
 wakefulness means something is happening 
 no you have to make your wakefulness 
 also restful it is just like 
 if you uh if you have an automobile 
 who is running at a very high rpm all 
 the time 
 it will naturally wear itself out 
 so it's important that you run cool 
 so if you are running running at a easy 
 pace your efficiency will go up your 
 ability to do things will go up your 
 competence will go up in everything 
 above all the number of hours that you 
 sleep will go down dramatically 
 say uh 
 for most people who are practicing 
 in engineering practices 
 their pulse rate is somewhere between 45 
 to 65. 
 many of them yes yes many of them below 
 45 between 35 to 45 also in sitting 
 states in restful states 
 so once your system is going at such an 
 ease 
 then the need for rest will come down 
 there was a time not anymore i'm i'm 
 becoming little old and lazy these days 
 so 1822.
 there was a time 
 three days and three nights if i don't 
 sleep i will still be perfectly normal 
 still doing all my activity whole night 
 i will drive next day whole day i will 
 teach whole night i will drive and again 
 i will teach like this 
 uh these days i couldn't do one night 
 next day i will need to rest a little 
 bit right right you take naps throughout 
 the day now yeah 
 no no no 
 no no okay 
 for almost 25 years 
 more than 25 years my average sleep time 
 was only two and a half hours 
 wow today i'm sleeping between three and 
 a half to four and a half hours you're 1859.
 getting lazy 1861.
 are you getting lazy 
 wow yeah i think i did a five mile run 
 yesterday and my average heart rate was 
 over 165 so i wonder if i can i wonder 
 if i can do now i'm pushing it pretty 
 hard on my run so i wonder is there a 
 way to work out hard 
 and keep the heart rate lower than 
 normal still even while you're pushing 
 and pumping so much blood 
 the important thing is 
 see how use easily oxygen 
 and nutrients are distributed to the 
 cellular level 
 that will determine see this is not been 
 generally they are not thinking on these 
 lines they are always thinking about 
 increasing the lung capacity yes that is 
 also important but the important thing 
 is 
 with how much ease the nutrients and 
 oxygen get to the cellular level 
 accordingly your pulmonary system will 
 function but it's not only about the 
 heart rate even at the cellular level 
 with how much 
 uh the stress or how much ease it's 
 going this can be determined we have 
 what is called as a cobra test for 
 people would you like to go through 
 cobra test 
 getting bit by a cobra 1934.
 no no no 
 if it doesn't bite you then it proves 
 something see 
 most of the venomous creatures are like 
 this particularly cobras in the wild if 
 you just go and pick up a cobra like 
 that he will simply come not holding his 
 head or anything 
 simply in the middle of the body simply 
 he will come effortlessly in your hands 
 without any reaction because he is only 
 sensing your chemistry 
 if you show little anxiety 
 if you show even a little bit of anxiety 
 he will go for you 
 if you don't show any he is very 
 comfortable with you because he senses 
 everything his safety and his danger 
 only by the chemistry of your body 
 so 
 this is a cobra test people say i claim 
 they are very meditative we say okay 
 let's do the cobra test 
 yeah that's uh that's do you do that 
 test with people 
 [Laughter] 
 we can check you out 165. 
 i love your uh 
 i'm really enjoying your inner 
 engineering course right now i've been 
 going through it and i'm really enjoying 
 it okay 
 you have a quote i think i'm gonna get 
 the quote correct i believe i wrote it 
 down 
 where you said 
 only what you perceive you know the rest 
 is imagination and you were talking 
 about that 
 uh in the context of what we learn in 
 school you were giving this example of 
 you know we only really have 50 of our 
 time available because the other 50 is 
 with our faculties and with sleep 
 and for many years we learn things the 
 content 2025.
 that we only use one percent is what i 
 remember you saying 
 what do you mean by this only what you 
 perceive 
 you know the rest is imagination 
 see uh 
 perception happens to you in five 
 different dimensions 
 seeing hearing smelling tasting touching 
 this is how you're perceiving life 
 this data data has gathered within you 
 only because this data has gathered 
 within you now you're able to walk on a 
 round planet which spins it's not a 
 small thing 
 it is not a small thing that you are 
 able to walk on a spinning round ball 
 because all this data has gathered 
 through five senses it is not 
 intellectual information but it is a 
 perceptional information if this 
 information is not there you won't be 
 able to walk actually 
 you will not be able to walk straight 
 this is what is happening for people 
 when some people lose their memory and 
 things like that suddenly they become 
 unstable in their body because some of 
 the data is gotten disconnected with 
 their system 
 so 
 this data that you perceive is most 
 important that's what a child is all the 
 time drinking up everything you see how 
 the child is looking at everything 
 because he wants to drink up as much 
 data as possible because instinctively 
 he knows without the data he will not be 
 able to function 
 so how attentive you are 
 how attentive your eyes are how 
 attentive your ears nose tongue and 2117.
 touch is accordingly you have that much 
 you know that much 
 uh usable information so why one person 
 is more efficient well you are an 
 athlete why one person is able to catch 
 a damn ball another person can't catch 
 the damn thing 
 why is it 
 because that level of attention of 
 exactly how that ball will behave how 
 you can anticipate where it will go this 
 is not there intellectually suppose you 
 have a phd in football you think you can 
 play football 2148.
 uh 
 if you have a phd i no i think you need 
 to experience it as well if you just 
 study it only yeah 
 no that is that is not experience it's 2158.
 perception 
 you are you're watching it out of your 
 keen interest you're watching exactly 
 how a ball moves you may not be thinking 
 the physics of it but you're watching it 
 and perceiving it because of that 
 perception you know something that you 
 cannot know by reading a hundred books 
 about it 
 that's true you've got to experience 
 life 
 of course 
 that's the only reason we are here 
 [Laughter] 
 to experience life as as profoundly as 
 possible absolutely what do you think is 
 is missing in the world the most right 
 now especially here in america there's a 
 lot of you know we have corona and then 
 people feel like they're suffering 
 they're angry they're 
 they feel unjust with a lot of different 
 things that are happening 
 what is missing in the world 
 so talking about those situations in 
 america 
 america has uh an unfortunately very 
 cruel history 
 whether 
 whether it concerns the native americans 
 or the african 
 americans today there's a very cruel 
 history 
 by trying to put it under the carpet 2228.
 it'll keep popping up 
 we have to come to terms with it 
 everybody has to come to terms with it 
 some remorse some 
 settlement must happen i think that 
 expression of remorse has not happened 
 so it keeps popping up well this one 
 policeman's inhuman act is not the real 
 thing the real thing is it's there in 
 the air 
 because whatever has happened in the 
 past certain number of people have 
 resentment about it 
 uh 
 and another set of people 
 somewhere maybe not exactly for me maybe 
 it may be wrong for me to say this but 
 somewhere they think that's a natural 
 natural order of life that's how it was 2270.
 supposed to be 
 somebody had to die somebody has to be a 
 slave that is how it is supposed to be 
 that must go we must understand 
 historically every one of us have made 
 mistakes 2283.
 we must bow down to our own mistakes and 
 say we are sorry for this let's see how 
 to create a new nation a new world this 
 much sincerity and humility should come 2292.
 in every human being otherwise one set 
 of people are resentful another set of 
 people think they deserve it 
 then how will this go 
 yeah 
 do you feel talking about mistakes of 
 the past i've made a lot of mistakes in 
 my past personally in just different 
 different ways from my business to 
 relationships to 
 family dynamics a lot of different 
 things and i'm constantly trying to 
 learn to be better every day do you feel 
 like you've made a lot of mistakes in 
 the past that 
 maybe you regret or you think to 
 yourself oh that was pretty that was 
 pretty stupid of me to do 
 or have you always been this enlightened 
 [Laughter] 
 i don't know i never looked at life as a 
 series of mistakes learning from that i 
 don't look at life like that 
 well 
 have you done made some dumb decisions 
 here and there of course 
 but 
 i wouldn't see them as mistakes i just 
 see them as part of growing up and 
 becoming more mature because 
 enlightenment is one thing you see 
 things clearly 
 but still operating in the world you 
 need wisdom wisdom you have to earn it 
 with experience there is simply no other 
 way for that 
 so you must stumble and fall and learn 
 and grow and 
 and just go through life not necessarily 
 i would not say 
 it is necessarily so because today it 
 has become fashionable with all these 
 management gurus and all saying you must 
 learn from your mistakes you must learn 
 mistakes that means you must keep on 
 doing mistakes 
 i don't believe that you must learn from 
 your mistakes i would rather live a life 
 where i don't do any mistakes 
 because life is so brief you do a bunch 
 of mistakes and then you will learn and 
 where will you use it in the grave 
 of other people's mistakes yeah 
 yes of course that is what being human 
 means that we can learn from other 
 people's experience from history we can 
 learn we don't have to do all those 
 things once again and especially you are 
 from the aviation state 
 if you are trying aviation or if you're 
 trying skydiving or something if you 
 don't do things right the first time 
 well that'll be the last time 
 where does karma fit in 
 around people that are 
 acting to harm or to not support 
 someone else's well-being or the things 
 around them how does karma feel all your 2448.
 identity is only from your memory isn't 
 it how are you an american 
 you remember that you were born in 
 america yes suppose area is your memory 
 are you american 
 suppose what 
 is humanity 
 am i american yeah 
 no 
 so how does your family identity come 
 how do your racial identity come 
 everything is by memory isn't it yeah 
 now karma means this accumulated massive 
 amount of memory 
 now 
 will you stand above that is this is the 
 stage for our life 
 this karmic background is like a 
 platform 
 if you create enough surface tension in 
 this 
 you can stand on it and do your fresh 
 act today 
 but if your feet sink into it like quick 
 sands then 
 you are just a victim of your memory 
 right now the person that you think is a 2500.
 racist 
 is a victim of his memory right 
 the person that you think is a terrorist 
 is a victim of his memory the person who 
 is a suicide bomber is a victim of his 
 memory because he remembers what has 
 been taught to him all right if he loses 
 his memory he's a fine guy right 
 right yes so right now you don't have to 
 lose your memory 
 where is your memory your memory is in 
 your body 
 and what you call as your mind which is 
 all one yeah right 
 this is hardware that is software 
 sure sure so this software you wrote it 
 unconsciously 
 through various incidents experiences 
 your own perception according to your 
 intelligence you wrote your own kind of 
 software unconsciously it's written by 
 you 
 but unconsciously 
 there have been cases where people have 
 sleep walked and committed a murder 
 even 
 the judiciary 
 thinks that is not worth punishing they 
 don't punish them even though they 
 committed murder sleepwalking 
 as far as the act is concerned somebody 
 died they lost their life not a small 
 thing 
 but this man was sleeping 
 so that man doesn't get punishment 
 because he was sleep walking 
 all right 
 he could have even killed himself in 
 sleepwalking it's possible right but 
 instead he killed somebody else so 
 essentially you're unconscious 
 so you're not punishable because you're 
 less than a child i'm saying 
 but the important thing is to become 
 conscious where is your memory it's in 
 the body it's in the mind 
 if you create a little distance between 
 you and your body between you and your 
 mind 
 this is the end of your karma 
 the end of your karma yes 
 the karmic influence i mean to say karma 
 is still there yes 
 karma is the richness of your life 
 okay if you have no karma you will be a 
 bimbo 
 right all right 
 there is karma there's the more rich and 
 vibrant the karma is the better only 
 thing is is it your platform to dance 
 upon or is it a quicksand that sucks you 
 in 
 most human beings right now are only 
 suffering their memory isn't it 
 yeah this moment they're not suffering 
 what happened yesterday they're 
 suffering what happened 10 days ago 
 they're suffering why what happened 25 
 years ago they're still suffering when 
 they hold on to the thought the memory 
 see it is not their choice 
 to think about the thought 
 they don't have to they're identified 
 with the situations in which they were 
 now it makes them suffer 
 today we know that a whole lot of 
 diseases that people are suffering are 
 psychosomatic 
 it does not mean they're always thinking 
 about it but it's working the memory is 
 working 
 depending on how strongly you're 
 identified let's say you're strongly 
 identified with your family structure 
 now 
 something happened in your family which 
 is not pleasant something very 
 unpleasant happened let's say 
 now you don't have to everyday think 
 about it slowly your face will become 
 like 
 a lot of people just because the memory 
 is working from inside you it doesn't 
 even ask you permission 
 it doesn't ask your permission should i 
 come or go 
 it just works on every cell in your body 
 slowly you lose your vibrancy what was a 
 vibrant exuberant person slowly becomes 
 like this has happened to more than 75 
 of the population right when they were 
 five six years of age how joyful and 
 exuberant lives they were 
 by the time they're 30 they're like this 
 what is their problem 
 what is their problem is somebody poking 2721.
 them no 
 because their karma is overtaking them 
 so the entire process of this book is 
 step by step way of standing above your 
 karma on the richness of your memory 
 because you can convert this memory into 
 manure and you can blossom upon that 
 because what happened yesterday you 
 cannot change 
 what is happening today you can only 
 experience what is tomorrow you have to 
 create 
 when you have i mean you've you've 
 experienced some bad things in the past 
 right some harmful things some 
 challenges pain you've you've felt these 
 things right 
 no past 
 people people try to do lots of bad 
 things and they're still doing lots of 
 them every day a whole bunch of people 
 abuse me people that i've never met 
 they have enormous hatred for me 
 you know like today what i've said a 
 whole lot of people will hit me for this 
 do you know yeah 
 because their identities are shaken 
 they have created false sense of 
 identity upon which they are standing 
 shaking 
 they know if this is gone they have 
 nothing to live for 
 they need to understand there is a life 
 beyond identities 
 identities are created for purpose of 
 action in a given situation it is none 
 of our identity identities are absolute 
 see first of all we need to understand 
 before you and me came here countless 
 number of people walk this planet where 
 are they all topsoil part of the manure 
 in this garden 
 yes sir no yes you and me what will we 
 be in 100 years time same thing same 
 thing unless your friends fear you may 
 raise from the dead and bury you real 
 deep 
 but no roots can get to you 
 i'm saying 
 so 
 we are just a small pop-up 
 in time 
 but we are thinking too much of 
 ourselves yeah 
 because we are we attached too much 
 self-significance to ourselves because 
 of that our identities have risen beyond 
 observed limitations can identities be 
 good at all 
 can having an identity without identity 
 you cannot function in the world 
 right now this is me that's you if this 
 identity is not there if you ask me a 
 question i will look like this 
 what's the point of that 
 no activity is possible without identity 
 the important thing is to it's like 
 wearing your clothes right now these are 
 my clothes see i wear loose clothes so 
 that always you're aware this is my 
 clothing this is not me 
 suppose i wear skin tight nylon clothes 
 after some time i don't know which is my 
 clothing which is my skin 
 that's all the thing is do you have a 
 space between you and what you have 
 created or are you stuck with it that's 
 the important thing 
 if you're stuck with it you will do 
 crazy things thinking you're doing good 
 things if you're held on to the identity 
 if you're attached to it 2902.
 ah it will 
 wrap you up 
 [Laughter] 
 once you create it and leave it it will 
 just wrap you up unless you're conscious 
 sure 
 so if you can see this is the entire 
 inner engineering process we are 
 offering is just this 
 if you do this practice which we call a 
 shambhavi if you sit here 
 your body is here your mind is out there 
 what is you is elsewhere 
 once there is a little space between you 
 and your body between you and your mind 
 this is it 
 one thing is there's no suffering within 
 you anymore because suffering happens 
 only two ways physical suffering mental 
 suffering do you know any other kind of 
 suffering 
 once there is once there is a little 
 distance this is the end of suffering 
 and above all this is the end of all 2948.
 identity and how do you distance the 
 suffering 
 you don't distance the suffering you 
 distance yourself from your own body and 
 your mind 
 this is what the practice is about 
 how to distance means this see right now 
 there are life energies 
 see when you are a five-year-old child 
 how much were you identified with your 
 body 
 i'm trying to remember a five-year-old 
 child um 
 how much do i identify as my body 
 i think i was probably exploring my body 2982.
 trying to not at five you were not 
 exploring anybody 
 my body i think i was like running and 
 jumping and i was like 
 using it but you're not identifying it 
 because every day it's changing you 
 can't even identify right right yes your 
 identity with the body got strengthened 
 when you became an adolescent okay that 
 is when when hormones started poisoning 
 your mind 
 when your hormones hijacked your 
 intelligence suddenly you lost your 3008.
 sense of who you are yeah otherwise you 
 as a life were far more exuberant than 
 your body can ever be 
 yes or no yes when a child laughs when a 
 child jumps when a child does these 
 things i'm still like this 
 i'm saying 
 you will see 
 body is just a thing to use yeah he is 
 not that just that's not the prime thing 
 the same was true with your intellect 
 and your mind also isn't it when you 
 were a child 
 so now you're curious you're exploring 
 you're yes because 
 it was changing and growing you're 
 questioning everything you you real you 
 you not that you consciously realize but 
 you know this is not it because your 
 exuberance is beyond that 
 if you keep your exuberance of life like 
 that today 
 very clearly you know 
 what is you what is your body what is 
 your mind when i say what is you 
 let us not give a definition to that but 
 your body we can define 
 it's a defined physical form so we can 
 define this how did this happen just the 
 food that you've eaten isn't it 
 it's a heap of food right 
 what you call as my mind is a heap of 
 impressions 
 what you gather whatever you gather 
 can be yours but can never ever be you 
 isn't it 3087.
 what you gather 
 right now 
 this cup 
 it's yours but it's not you yes 
 your thoughts 
 are yours but they're not you they're 
 not you because yesterday you had one 
 kind of thought today you have another 
 tomorrow you may have different thoughts 
 does the collection of your thoughts 3103.
 make up you no 
 what makes up you 
 are you asking me 
 [Laughter] 
 see this is the problem you 
 want to get life into a definition 
 you can only define that which has 
 distinct physical boundaries 
 anything which doesn't have a physical 
 boundary you cannot define that isn't it 3130.
 it's boundless 
 don't go there that is also a definition 
 because that's just a word okay all 
 right 
 all right boundless is a good word but 
 still it is just a word people think 
 boundless means oh maybe like that 
 boundary means like this no no that is 
 also a boundary isn't it sure yeah when 
 you are a child 
 uh maybe this house compound was your 
 world 
 today your world might have expanded 
 but still it's a boundary right 
 larger boundary but still it's a 
 boundary but there is something 
 naturally within every human being that 
 the moment you realize you're restricted 
 by a boundary you want to go beyond that 
 whoever you are right now yeah you want 
 to be something more don't touch this 
 okay i want to tell you no no i'm not 
 talking about that see whoever you are 
 right now you want to be something more 
 yeah if that's something more happens 
 tomorrow 
 you want to be something more isn't it 
 why is that 
 that's what i'm saying this is an innate 
 longing within the human being because 
 there is something within you which is 
 not physical in nature 
 it doesn't like boundaries 
 till you experience that 
 you will think you by shopping you will 
 expand your boundaries by ambition you 
 will expand your boundaries by conquest 
 you will expand your boundaries see 
 always a human being is seeing how to be 
 something more if it finds a very basic 
 physical expression we call this 
 sexuality 
 what sexuality means is 
 something that is not you you're trying 
 to experience is it a part of yourself 
 it works for a few moments 
 then anyway two people are separate 
 if it happens mentally it is called 
 ambition conquest or simply shopping 
 different people do it different ways 
 if it happens on an emotional level we 
 call it love 
 what love means is somebody who is not 3243.
 you you want to experience them as a 
 part of yourself 
 but if you do it consciously we call it 
 yoga 
 that if you do it successfully it's 
 called yoga yoga does not mean twisting 
 and turning yoga means union that means 
 you consciously obliterated the 
 boundaries of your individual 
 individuality so that you experience the 
 union 
 with everything this is not an idea this 3267.
 is not a philosophy this is the nature 
 of the existence most people get it only 
 when you bury them unfortunately 
 when we have emotions 
 thoughts or feelings emotions of anger 
 resentment from something that happened 
 in the past 
 upset that we see on social media 
 frustrations in the world where should 
 we be redirecting these thoughts 
 feelings and emotions should we be 
 feeling them and allowing ourselves to 
 go with anger until it stops 
 should we be 
 guarding our thoughts with with the 
 reverse of that 
 what's your 
 ideas on thoughts and uh feeling and 
 emotions 
 you must punch a window pane or a wall 
 better 
 a stone wall is good 
 you're available yeah exactly 
 because that is the model that the 
 hollywood and the television shows 
 everything is setting up when you get 
 angry you break something all right 
 exactly so 
 see first of all people are assuming 
 that 
 anger is happening to them 
 or misery is happening to them no this 
 is exactly what i said earlier maybe i 
 didn't articulate it fully no you are 
 creating anger you are creating misery 
 you are creating joy you are creating 
 whatever all this is happening from 
 within you 
 is it true all human experience is 
 happening from within us 
 uh it's it's yeah because we perceive 
 something and then we 
 something else something else may 
 stimulate but human experience is 
 happening from within us isn't it right 
 whether it's love or hate or anger or 
 misery or joy or anything is only 
 happening from within us the simple 
 question i am asking is what happens 
 from within you 
 should you have should it happen your 
 way or somebody else's way 
 it should happen your way 
 of course because the world will never 
 happen your way 100 
 because there are so many stakeholders 
 in the world little bit will happen my 
 way a little bit your way that is fine 
 but what happens within me must happen 
 my way if what happens within me does 
 not happen my way this is the worst form 
 of slavery isn't it wow 
 somebody decides what happens within me 
 somebody decides where i should sit this 
 is slavery everybody understands this 3419.
 now somebody decides whether i am happy 
 or unhappy isn't this the worst form of 
 slavery yeah 
 so this is the liberation that humanity 
 needs to work at this is what inner 
 engineering means inner engineering is 3433.
 not some 
 mechanical process because engineering 
 means this essentially you will say 
 something is well engineered only if it 
 works the way you want 
 something 
 if this one doesn't work the way you 
 want 
 what the hell are you expecting other 
 things to work the way you want it's 
 just an accident when you live 
 accidentally anxiety is normal 
 yes it's every day 
 but when you're living on purpose and 
 intentionally and mindfully you should 
 be able to shift out of that no no no no 
 i wouldn't use those words okay what 
 words would you use 
 when you say purpose 
 intention mindful 
 see this is the whole problem with 
 people their mind is full all the time 
 right 
 my mind is just empty all the time 
 nothing happening 
 nothing 
 that's why i wear a turban just to make 
 it substantial 
 [Laughter] 
 there's nothing in my head if i'm 
 walking there i'm just walking nothing 
 happens 
 because 
 see right now your hands are there 
 suppose your one hand starts jumping 
 like this oh what if let's say my hand 
 starts jumping like this what will you 
 think you think satguru has some kind of 
 a isn't it 
 i just don't know that's the that's the 
 way intelligent people do things you 
 know 
 no no suppose my hand starts jumping 
 like that you will think there is some 
 ailment isn't it 
 you will think i am maybe mr parkinson's 
 is visiting me or something like that 
 sure 
 so your mind is jumping all the all over 
 the place why is that not an ailment i'm 
 asking 
 your only comfort is other people cannot 3540.
 see it isn't it 
 yeah i guess they see it through the 
 manifestation of you being anxious or 
 tense or stressed or angry or whether 
 they see it or not they see it or not if 
 any part of you is simply jumping 
 without purpose is that an ailment i'm 
 asking 
 if any part of you is jumping without 
 purpose is it an ailment um 
 well i think in your inner engineering 
 course you talk about how we have 3567.
 certain faculties that we can't control 
 like going to the bathroom and doing 
 certain things that are part of our body 
 so yeah but i don't know if that's a 
 trick 
 no no the p the p is just filling up in 
 the bladder it's not jumping all over 
 the place catch your catch here 
 if it jumps all over place that is an 
 ailment that's an ammo yes correct 
 right now suppose let me take a worse 
 example suppose your hand starts beating 
 you in the face that's an ailment yes 
 for sure so right now your thoughts and 
 emotions are beating you up from inside 
 why is that not an ailment i'm saying 
 no it is 
 so 
 let us not think anger happens to us 
 resentment happens to us no 
 these things we are creating 
 we have the power to emote we can make 
 it love we can make it joy we can make 3620.
 it ecstasy but people have chosen to 
 make it tension anger resentment hatred 
 they have turned it that way now they 
 will claim this is because life has been 
 unfair to me 
 life has not been fair to anybody 
 especially not me 
 [Laughter] 
 life is not fair to anybody life is 
 simply rolling it's for you to learn to 
 ride it sometimes we're in uncomfortable 
 situations some for sometimes we're in 
 comfortable situations sometimes we're 
 in situations where we know exactly what 
 to do and sometimes we're in situations 
 where we don't know what to do sometimes 
 somebody else is controlling the 
 situation sometimes you're controlling 
 the situation this is how life is 
 if you are constantly stepping into 
 unfamiliar situations in your life that 
 means you are growing at a rapid pace 
 if you are in constantly in comfortable 
 situations that means you are a stagnant 
 life 
 [Music] 
 so if you if you look for comfort if you 
 look for a comfort zone 
 because the moment your thoughts and 
 emotions are going to torment you with 
 external stimulant external stimulation 
 that happens what will you choose you 
 will choose a comfort zone 
 this means you will limit your life 
 so the moment somebody can cause you 
 pain or suffering this means unknowingly 
 you will make the very scope of your 
 life very limited 
 only when a person loses this fear of 
 suffering 
 that no matter what happens this is how 
 i will be if this assurance comes to you 
 then you walk full stride because 
 whatever happens in the life around you 
 it will not really make you suffer 
 once you you're free from suffering only 
 when you're free from suffering when 
 you're free from the fear of suffering 
 that is when you will explore your life 
 in full depth and dimension 
 how do we rid ourselves of the fear of 
 suffering then 
 see as i told you the suffering is 
 happening because your faculties are not 
 held in your hands 
 if i have to go to this in little detail 
 i will have to take a few minutes 
 see for example if i ask you a simple 
 question 
 do you want your intellect to be sharp 
 or blunt what is your choice sharp 
 sharp of course so you understand your 
 intellect is the better the sharper it 
 is the better it is it's like a knife 
 so if it's like a knife it's a cutting 
 instrument 
 so if you give anything to your 
 intellect it will dissect everything and 
 see this is the nature of our intellect 
 you don't have to physically dissect but 
 it dissects everything and sees what is 
 this what is that this is the nature of 
 the intellect without dissection it 
 doesn't know because it is a knife it's 
 like a scalpel 
 it must be sharp a knife that is not 
 sharp is no good knife isn't it right 
 so good for butter 
 yeah 
 that also depends if it just comes out 
 of the refrigerator even that it won't 
 cut 
 so 
 if uh 
 if you're using a knife to do everything 
 to do everything let's say you eat with 
 a knife you brush with your knife and 
 you do everything with your knife of 
 course you will be bleeding 
 that's all that's happening only one 
 dimension of intelligence within us 
 in yogic way of looking at things we 
 look at mind as 16 parts 
 this intellect is just one part because 
 our education systems are such which are 
 totally intellect oriented 
 human beings largely are using only one 
 dimension of their intellect to do 
 everything you use a knife to stitch 
 your clothes what will you wear only 
 tatters see that's what you're seeing in 
 los angeles right now half the people 
 are wearing tattered clothes maybe they 
 used a knife to stitch their jeans 
 exactly with holes yes 
 so if you use a knife to stitch that's 
 what will happen all tatters right now 
 human life is in tatters mainly because 
 of this 
 instead of using a needle you're using a 
 knife 3877.
 so intellect is a very good instrument 
 of survival if you want to survive on 
 this planet you need a sharp intellect 
 the sharper it is the better you will 
 survive 
 but that will not make life that will 
 not put everything together right now 
 because through intellectual process 
 people are trying to handle everything 
 with so much care they're trying to do 
 everything right right right right under 
 blunder 
 the result is a blunder everything right 
 but the end result is a big blunder 
 because you're using a knife to do 
 everything 
 [Music] 
 okay here's a here's a 
 question for you when you when was the 
 last time that you felt 
 anger or resentment 
 and actually expressed it i was just 
 thinking of getting angry with you just 
 now 
 perfect 
 bring it 
 i love that 
 the thing is louis 
 i 
 i did not give this privilege to anybody 
 that somebody can make me happy somebody 
 can make me unhappy somebody can make me 
 i'm angry somebody can make me miserable 3952.
 i have not given that privilege to 
 anybody it's not that i'm incapable of 
 all these things if i want i can be all 
 those things right but 
 i have not give given this privilege to 
 anybody they can't do something to me 
 and make me angry no 
 i have not given that privilege to 
 anyone did you have did you have that 
 experience or give that privilege to 
 someone when you were younger did you 
 learn that at a certain point where you 
 transitioned till till i was 23 24 years 
 of age 
 from the age of probably 11 12 i was 
 always 24 hours angry 
 really 
 almost yes 
 because i was i was on this binge of 
 what is justice and injustice 
 huh so once you start looking what is 
 justice and injustice 
 just about everything in the world looks 
 unjust 
 everything makes you feel small 
 yeah yeah everything anything unjust 
 means it makes me angry 
 and everywhere i see whether at home in 
 school on the street in the society in 
 the country in the world 
 wherever i see i think this is unjust 
 this is unjust this and just 
 so much injustice always angry 
 right 
 i mean i feel like there's a lot there's 
 a lot of people in the in america and in 
 the world who a lot of things make them 
 angry and there's a lot of unjustice for 
 people so when when did you shift 4034.
 and how did you come to that realization 
 that this no longer works for you in 
 your life 
 see it doesn't work for anybody 
 that's true not just for me 
 but for you personally when did you 
 realize 
 the reason why people 
 think anger is some kind of a virtue 
 because they say righteous anger all 
 right right now america is cheating with 
 anger 
 and they think it's righteous anger 
 this is simply because 
 it takes some horrible thing to 
 stimulate them into action 
 there's not enough love in your heart to 
 stimulate yourself into action 
 something has to poke you you must get 
 angry and then it propels you into 
 action 
 so that kind of action sometimes will 4080.
 produce results of course 
 but 
 if you want genuine results which will 
 be good for everybody we must do it when 
 everything is right 
 but when everything is little 
 comfortable nobody does anything when 
 something horrible happens then we will 
 get angry and propel ourselves to 
 interaction 
 right now 
 this propelling yourself into action 
 with anger how long will you keep it up 4108.
 you cannot keep it forever yeah you get 
 tired yes 
 if you keep it up forever 
 you you will destroy yourself and you 
 will destroy everything around yourself 
 so 
 anger is become valuable because most 
 people are so lethargic in their 
 responses once in a way when they get 4127.
 angry 
 they feel empowered and seem to be doing 
 right things once in a way 
 you must be doing those right things all 
 your life then by the end of your life 
 everything might not have changed but 
 you would have made a difference 
 that's the way the world works hmm 
 so how i 
 man 
 so if people are lethargic and 
 comfortable a lot of the times and 
 they're unwilling to 
 choose love and act with love to make a 
 change 
 how do we get people to wake up when 
 things are calmer so that they can act 
 with love and get the change in the 
 results they want 
 see today 
 this whole moment 
 what uh you're seeing as inner 
 engineering is a moment 
 from religion to responsibility in a way 
 essentially what i mean is 
 religion means people are thinking 
 responsibility somewhere up there 
 where is that up nobody knows all right 
 you just have to believe where is that 
 up but 
 now you are sitting in california i am 
 here in tamil nadu 
 if i look up i'm looking at looking up 
 in one direction if you look up you are 4206.
 looking up in another direction 
 so my app is different europe is 
 different and by tomorrow morning again 
 my up will be yours europe will be mine 
 be a big confusion the damn planet is 
 spinning and it's round which way is up 
 does anybody know 
 which way is up in this universe 
 is it marked somewhere in the cosmos 
 this side up 
 there is no such thing so responsibility 
 is up there 
 no no no it must come here 
 we must understand if we want to live in 
 a wonderful world 
 it's only us and us and us who can make 
 this happen 
 no other force from anywhere is going to 
 make this happen 
 unless we realize 
 on transform ourselves from religion to 
 responsibility that it's here what this 
 whole thing has come up is see because 
 we have no explanation for creation 
 before you and me came so much creation 
 has happened who did it 
 a simplistic childish understanding of 
 this is a big man must have done it so 
 he's somewhere up there because you 
 can't see him here he must be up there 
 now of course women are claiming why not 
 it be a woman 
 in india we sorted these problems out 
 there we have man gods we're women gods 
 we have snake god we have cow god we 
 have elephant god we have every kind 
 crawling once creeping ones flying once 
 because we foresaw all the future 
 problems that may happen 
 you don't know who will claim what 
 tomorrow so we said everything is god 
 so what i'm saying is our idea of god 
 has essentially come because we have no 
 explanation for creation 
 how did all this happen such a complex 
 fantastic stuff who did it 
 because we are human we think it must be 
 a big human being suppose you and me 
 were buffalos having conversation right 
 now 
 we would definitely think god is a huge 
 buffalo isn't it 
 nobody could argue with us about that we 
 would definitely say he's a huge buffalo 
 because that would be our imagination 
 right now this is our imagination it's 
 fine if you are using it to settle a few 
 things if you are using it as a way of a 
 psychological process fine but 
 solace is one thing solutions for life 
 is a different thing so one first thing 
 that we must decide is those who are in 
 extreme states of poverty 
 war other kinds of misery imposed upon 4356.
 them only for them you must give solace 
 rest of us who have eaten our breakfast 
 today morning or dinner 
 we should talk about solution not solace 
 solace is just a psychological process 
 to settle something within you 
 but why people who have eaten well 
 people who are healthy people who have a 
 life to live 
 why are they psychological problem they 
 should not have any psychological 
 problems that's all i'm saying i know 
 this will be very cruel for a lot of 
 people but they better get it because 
 life is brief if they don't get it now 
 and they think being psychologically 
 disturbed is normal they will spend 
 their life like this it is not normal to 
 be healthy is normal 
 to be balanced is normal to be joyful is 
 normal look at yourself when you're five 
 years of age were you 
 miserable or joyful and somebody had to 
 make you 
 take the joy out of you by poking you 
 with something otherwise joy wouldn't go 
 you would be bouncing all over the place 4415.
 isn't it today somebody has to make you 
 happy somebody has to work hard to make 
 you happy 
 so at that time somebody had to work 
 hard to make you miserable 
 today somebody has to make you work hard 
 to make you happy the whole equation has 
 gotten reversed what is it 4431.
 what is it that happened to you you just 
 grew up if you grew up life should 
 become better when you grow up isn't it 
 all other life you see a little plant 
 when it grows up into a tree does it 
 become better or worse 
 becomes better it becomes good 
 everything becomes better only human 
 beings are saying oh childhood was so 
 fantastic my adulthood is misery why 
 this must be the best time 
 the old age must be the most fantastic 
 time 
 before we continue this video make sure 
 to subscribe below and turn on the 
 notification bell right now so you don't 
 miss out on these great videos every 
 single day 
 if all this is there how do i live clean 
 how do i live happy how do you eliminate 
 the waste the trash you don't have to 
 eliminate the waste waste is very 
 valuable if you know right now in this 
 garden they buy waste at a very annoying 
 way a very exorbitant price 
 because their waste goes into the public 
 system they have to buy waste from 
 somewhere they have to buy filth to 
 fertilize yes 
 so whether you turn your filth into a 
 fertilizer 
 or you smear it on your face and walk 
 around that's your choice this is why 
 karma so what kind of karma happened in 
 my life till this moment 
 is not always my choice so many things 
 have happened 
 but what kind of karma i perform right 
 now in this moment is 100 my choice will 
 i use this filth as manure and blossom 
 into your wonderful fragrance or 
 will i smear it around me and walk 
 around with filth this is the choice 
 everybody has 
 when unpleasant things happen to us 
 which happens to everybody in some way 
 if you're living in the world i'm saying 
 unless you drop from somewhere else 
 right if you're living in this world so 
 many unpleasant things happen 
 now with these unpleasant things do you 
 become wise or do you become wounded 
 this is a choice 
 to exercise this choice there must be a 4554.
 little space 
 when i say little space 
 where is your memory stored 
 people think here 
 your brain has very little memory 
 okay every cell in the body carries a 
 trillion times more 
 memory than your entire brain 
 every cell in the body every cell in the 
 body because if i take one cell from you 
 we can uh you know create you completely 
 in a lab that means what well your 
 parents your father and mother gave you 4588.
 only one sell each they were not very 
 generous 
 only one cell each see a whole man came 
 out of it yeah 
 so in that one cell all this memory head 
 to toe 
 everything was there isn't it 
 no mystic 
 texture of the hair texture of the skin 
 the nails the works 
 every detail to the minute detail was it 
 packed in that one cell or no yeah yes 
 so every cell in your body carries a 
 trillion times more memory than your 
 entire brain carries wow so if you do 
 not use that 
 if you just use one part of your body 
 then everything seems to be stressful 
 everything seems to be a struggle today 
 everybody complaining about everything 
 everything is stressful you are a 
 toddler 
 you have stress of diapers 
 you are a teenager you have hormonal 
 stress your middle age you have crisis 
 your old age geriatric stress right all 
 right which is not stress your entire 
 life stress tell them okay you die oh 4653.
 that is enormous stress 
 so this is not because there is 
 something wrong with anybody's life it's 
 simply because it's like you have a car 
 it's supposed to go on four wheels try 
 to drive on one okay one may look like 
 too much try to drive one two 
 well within ten miles your tires will 
 burst 
 because too much stress on one point 
 other things are not being used this is 4677.
 all that's happening to human beings are 
 we stressing our minds too much 
 see when we say mind see again your hand 
 went right here are we stressing our 
 minds no there is an entire there is a 
 mind across this body what is it that 
 you call as a mind a certain combination 
 of memory and intelligence is mind your 
 whole body's mind yes 
 in yoga we see physical body mental body 
 energetic body etheric body bliss body 
 like this everything is body 
 because it is right across it is not in 
 any one place 
 only intellectual activity is here 
 okay 
 right now because modern societies 
 particularly western societies have 
 become such slaves of their intellect 
 because of that they think everything is 
 here right intellect works only with the 
 data that you have gathered 
 you cannot function beyond your data 
 that means you will remain so small 
 because even if you've read the 
 libraries on this planet 
 what you know in terms of data 
 is minuscule compared to what this 
 cosmos is 
 with that minuscule you think you're 
 very intelligent because you're 
 analyzing and processing anyway all 4748.
 these people who think they're 
 intellectually very smart are going to 
 feel dumb stupid in the next five years 
 because your phone will be far more 
 smarter than you 
 already people are calling it a 
 smartphone see why would you call 
 somebody or something smart only because 
 it's smarter than you right 
 right yeah yeah otherwise you wouldn't 
 all right so right now too much 
 dependence on intellect because our 
 education systems are crafted like this 
 not exploding other dimensions of 
 intelligence at all 
 see intellect if i ask you this simple 
 question would you like your intellect 
 to be sharp or blunt choose choose 
 quickly 
 yes 
 [Laughter] 
 so essentially 
 intellect is like a knife if you want to 
 dissect something it's very good yeah 
 so 
 now the only instrument that you have is 
 a knife in your hand 
 you want to stitch your clothes 
 if you stitch your clothes with the 
 knife what will happen you will be in 
 tatters right this is what is happening 
 to people's lives 
 they are trying to fix everything with 
 their intellect the harder they try 
 the more tattoos they will become with 
 all this education tell me uneducated 
 people 
 are more unhappy or educated people are 
 more unhappy 
 in the world it depends what type of 
 education 
 no generally illiterate people in the 
 rest of the world tribes and this and 
 that even in india many many people 
 whenever i visit um 
 i go to guatemala 
 almost every year and i visit small 
 villages and the kids seem so happy yeah 
 it seems so they didn't go to school 
 they don't have much but they have 
 family they have community what do you 
 mean they don't have money i mean they 
 don't have much in terms of the 
 environmentally disastrous that's what 
 you say right exactly yeah they don't 
 have a lot in the material side of 
 things but they have a lot 
 in their hearts richness connection 
 community love and they seem very happy 
 uneducated people or illiterate people 
 are happier than the educated people 
 with education your life should have 
 become better isn't it 
 unfortunately they're becoming unhappy 
 simply because 
 they only have sharpened their knife 
 and a sharp knife in your hand and 
 you're unconscious you're cutting 
 yourself all the time all the time 
 cutting yourself you don't need any 
 outside help you can stab yourself yes 
 so people come to me and say satguru my 
 boss he's horrible my mother-in-law 
 she's not even human my wife she's such 
 a pain my husband like this 
 i say you come here to the yoga center 
 i'll make sure your boss mother-in-law 
 wife husband nobody enters this place 
 just you 
 i'll give you a nice place to live good 
 food to eat 
 nothing to do just be happy that's all 
 yeah you must be just joyful 
 i'll make random checks on you 
 if i find you unhappy or miserable 
 then i won't feed you because i don't 
 believe in feeding 
 misery 
 if you remain joyful i will feed you for 
 the rest of your life and take care of 
 you like you're my prized guest but if 
 you show misery we won't feed you 
 well you leave them in one room for 24 
 hours 
 you will see in how many ways they'll 
 twist themselves out is unbelievable 
 because when you're alone if you're 
 miserable obviously you're in bad 
 company 
 right i'm with you i'm miserable i think 
 it's because of this guy i'm miserable 
 this guy i'm miserable i'm sitting here 
 alone and miserable 
 now 
 right 
 who is causing misery how do we get out 
 of that though no essentially one must 
 understand human experience is caused 
 from within not from outside right 
 what we do arrangements we do outside in 
 the form of home family automobile this 
 that these are arrangements to 
 facilitate our activity 
 they are not going to make you happy or 
 unhappy but right now the car sellers 
 are telling you only this is joy this mo 
 this guy i'm sorry i'm not against any 
 brand i like the brand they say this car 
 is joy i know somebody else says this 
 car is loud 
 oh all the best this is power this is 
 yeah power is okay car has power 
 but where is love exuding from the 
 engine or you're executing from the 
 engine all right 
 power all right 
 but right now if you uh you know this is 
 something i've been noticing it's only 
 in recent times probably last 10-15 
 years if you look at any car i look at 
 every advertisement 
 whether they're selling an automobile or 
 a machine or a crane or an earth mover 
 because i'm interested in anything that 
 works not that i'm going to buy them 
 so when i look at it 
 car ads nobody's telling you what's the 
 engine what's the transmission what's 5045.
 the power what's the torque nothing 
 they're talking about the leather 
 they're talking about the wood paneling 
 they're talking about the stereo 
 are you buying you buying a sitting room 
 you want to buy a drawing room or do you 
 want a car 
 if i want a car i would look at the 
 engine how it is made what does it do 
 no nothing 
 only why is that because they're buying 
 a car for neighbors and we they're not 
 buying a car because they love to drive 
 a good machine 
 yeah 
 it's always about being better than 
 somebody else why do we obsess over that 
 in general 5083.
 and is that mostly in america do you see 
 that all right no no it's everywhere 
 america kind of setting the you know 
 path breaking the standard we're the 
 best at trying to be the best 
 so this is uh unfortunate cultivation 
 that is happening from kindergarten 
 if you are going to school what your 
 parents will say you must be number one 
 [Music] 
 if you are number one what about all the 
 other 30 40 kids who are there they must 
 be below you they're losers they're 
 losers 5113.
 so your joy 
 is only in other people failing 
 when your joy is about other people's 
 misery 
 that's not joy that is sickness 
 right now whole world is invested in 
 this 
 is not just america america kind of 5130.
 displace it like that not that it's not 
 there everywhere in the else in the 
 world everywhere it's there but here 
 it's being shamelessly displayed they 
 are little shy everywhere left of the 
 world but still they got it yeah 
 what would what would the world look 
 like if we 
 chose to lift everyone up and celebrate 
 other people succeeding or or being 
 happy or whatever it looks like for them 
 to succeed what would the world look 
 like 
 see uh 5156.
 i see in america everybody keeps talking 
 about family family family 
 but you've forgotten just us maybe a 
 century ago yeah 
 maybe a century ago or even 70 years ago 
 or 50 years ago if you said family it 
 meant crime 
 why 
 because the families were running the 
 crime oh wow of course 
 they always refer to crime as family 
 because family is a crime 
 really 
 let me come to that i know that this 
 will get me into trouble 
 see there is only one crime and there's 
 only one evil in the world that is 
 limited identity 
 how much crime you will commit simply 
 depends on how empowered you are 
 say one more time how much crime you 5207.
 commit simply depends on how empowered 
 you are how empowered you are yeah 
 if you are highly empowered and your 
 identity is very limited you will do 
 terrible things 
 so the most important thing is 
 to enhance or to expand one's identity 
 how do we do that 
 see for example traditionally in the 
 yogic culture in india 
 before we start education for a child 
 the first and foremost thing is 
 that he must take a cosmic identity 
 a cosmic identity yes he has to take 
 that what is that what does that look 
 like so if i'm a child yeah in your 
 teaching so the thing is one thing is 
 there is a 
 mantra which says that that he has to 
 say it again and again he has to look at 
 the sky and say it he'll look at the 
 earth and say it look at the air and say 
 look at the fire and say all the 5258.
 elements of water and sat 
 because these are all the composition of 
 the 
 cosmos you look at empty space and say 
 it you look at water and say it you look 
 at fire and say it you look at the earth 
 and say it 
 so that you understand your identity is 
 limitless why this is being done wow 5278.
 why this is being done is education is 
 seen as an empowerment 
 you should not empower a person 
 who 
 has a limited identity because he will 
 cause havoc 
 i'll take the worst example which will 
 get me into trouble 
 sure see everybody talks about you're 
 not even supposed to mention this name 
 adolf hitler 
 well 
 many people have been there who caused 
 enormous pain to other human beings 
 but i don't think anybody managed to 
 organize it 
 mechanize it 
 and really deliver it like a factory of 
 misery 
 like this man did right all right it's a 
 factory yeah literally a factory of 
 misery manufacturing misery properly 
 organized 
 but do you think 
 there aren't thousands or hundreds and 
 thousands of people with the same 
 mindset in the world absolutely they are 
 only thing is they are not empowered 
 like him competence is the only thing 
 that's lacking tyranny is there in 
 people's mind 
 there are as much tyrants as adolf 
 hitler you may find them in a school 
 teacher you may find them in your 
 parents you may find them all around you 
 in your neighborhood only fortunately 
 they are not as potent at that man that 
 man is super competent that is the 
 problem so right now human competence 
 becomes a terrible problem 
 simply because you have a limited 
 identity 
 so 
 you invest your identity in a family you 
 invest your identity in a community race 
 religion nationality your relationships 
 your tell me in the name of nations in 
 the name of race in the name of 
 religions in the name of communities 
 how much 
 terrible how many terrible things have 
 we done in this world 
 it's still happening today no the most 
 terrible believe what's happening today 
 just look back in the last 100 years all 5390.
 for someone's identity pride country 
 city 
 state religion all these things how you 
 just take 20th century okay one century 
 past 21st century is just progressing 5401.
 now 
 20th century take it 
 in the name of race what all have we 
 done to each other yeah in the name of 
 religion what have we done to each other 
 in the name of nationality what all have 
 we done to each other just look back and 
 see we have literally killed half the 
 world's population in 20th century 
 because of identity yes 
 of a philosophy of an ideology 
 people have killed all right right 
 so limited identity and empowerment is a 5428.
 disaster 
 but we are continuously cultivating this 
 all the time so i said family is crime 
 because family is the first identity 
 that you take 5439.
 after that comes community after that 
 comes maybe race or religion or 
 nationality 
 right now nationality is reasonably the 
 largest identity you're taking 
 within this nation it looks nice that 
 you are committed as an american to the 
 well-being of america 
 but just see who is fighting who in this 
 world 
 a good indian is fighting a good 
 pakistan 
 a good hindu is fighting a good muslim a 
 good american fighting just about 
 anybody 
 because you never fought a war here you 
 go out and fight all over the world 
 well you will find reasons as to why you 
 fought that war and the heroic nature of 
 it i know people who lost their lives 
 believing that they're doing the best 
 thing in their life yes but i want you 
 to know that man that you think is 
 horrible that terrorist that miscreant 
 that uh militant or whatever you want to 
 call him 5498.
 that guy also like a suicide bomber 
 see anybody for every human being or 
 even for an aunt 
 it's life is precious you try to catch 
 him see he'll do everything possible to 
 save his life 
 so somebody to throw away their life 
 like this 
 obviously what they believe in means 
 much more than their life crazy right 
 yeah it's not crazy 
 see if they do it your way you it's 
 heroic if they do it their way it's 
 crazy i'm not trying to support 
 terrorism or something i'm just telling 
 you it's limited identity 
 genocides have been committed because of 
 limited identity 
 nations have been raised down because of 
 limited identity evil things we have 
 done to each other on individual level 
 simply because of limited identity so 
 this is what yoga means yoga means union 
 that means you consciously obliterated 
 the boundaries of your individual nature 
 and your experience of life expanded 
 once you sit here and you experience 
 everything around you as a part of 
 yourself after that you do not need any 
 morality you do not need any 
 commandments thou shalt not cut the tree 
 thou shalt not kill this man thou shall 
 not rob this this is meaningless to you 
 when you have experienced something as a 
 part of yourself 
 so the entire system of yoga i'm when i 
 say yoga i mean yoga all right not the 
 yoga that's happening in los angeles 
 studios 
 i have nothing around them but i'm 
 saying we've reduced it too right 5587.
 something just to blow an identity 
 around yes yeah still twisting and 
 turning your body it's good for you 
 you'll become flexible and may be 
 healthy that's good for you but i want 
 you to understand would you not wish 
 that adolf hitler was a sick man instead 5602.
 of a healthy man 
 i would not wish that yeah i wish he was 
 a healthy man huh i would wish he was a 
 healthy man he was healthy that's a 
 problem i'm saying you wish he was uh a 
 sick man yeah would you wouldn't you be 5614.
 happy if you got cancer at 25. and you 
 wouldn't kill all these people who 
 wouldn't set up this factory 
 yeah i wish they wouldn't have died so 
 i'm saying 5622.
 health becomes a curse competence 5625.
 becomes occurs individual intelligence 
 becomes occurs why because you have 
 limited identity it's in that context i 
 said 
 family is crime 
 family is a wonderful place where people 
 are supporting each other like you said 
 is it not important if you create a 
 world where everybody is supporting each 
 other to do their best well that's 
 happening in the family that's the most 
 beautiful aspect of the family but why 
 is it only limited to those four people 
 or five people or whatever 
 what should what should families start 
 to reconsider about 
 their unity their their connection how 
 could they expand it to something 
 greater than just the family of four or 
 six 
 in this home living this way i don't 
 know if you've heard even political 
 leaders in india for example wherever 
 our prime minister goes to united 
 nations he will say vasudeva 
 come this means 
 the world is my family 
 it's a chant that always he says is the 
 world is our family 
 uh because this has to be inculcated 
 from childhood 
 that your identity 
 is not about a few people who are born 
 around you or people a couple of people 
 who bore you your identity is there that 
 you breathe is your identity yeah this 
 is your life 
 so if you identify with the air that you 
 breathe 
 what is it that's not you and what is it 
 that's you 
 everything's you yes 
 if everything is you your intelligence 
 is a boon your competence is a boon 
 your intelligence your competence your 
 capabilities everything is a gift to the 
 world right 
 but 
 if your identity is small 
 all the wonderful things that human 
 being has becomes a curse 
 see right now our intelligence 
 so much science technology we developed 
 but the cutting edge of science and 
 technology always goes into military 
 equipment isn't it first at least 
 many of these things will never come to 
 you on the street it's always there all 
 right 
 only when every other nation has maybe 
 then it will come to you sure sure till 
 then it's just kept there so our 
 intelligence is going into destructive 
 force why limited identity but right now 
 can i just open up the borders of this 
 nation and say i love everybody we are 
 not there 
 we are not it there the world is not in 
 there we cannot do that all right 
 we still need nationality we still need 
 all these things but we can hold it 
 little lightly 
 we don't have to hold it like it is 
 absolute it is not absolute it's 
 something that we have done 
 our idea of family is our making our 
 idea of community is our making our idea 
 of race religion everything is our 
 making our idea of nationality is our 5789.
 making so don't treat it like it's an 5791.
 absolute 
 what would happen if we opened up every 
 border in every country that would be 
 possible 
 only if there was no economic disparity 
 if there was no economic disparity there 
 were no national boundaries about two 
 centuries ago people could walk wherever 
 they want there were no visas and 
 passports anywhere because economically 
 reasonably everybody was in the what 
 about race though would people be 
 [Music] 
 you know well india india is a classic 
 example 
 if you if you travel from north to south 
 every 50 kilometers people will look 
 different they dress different they talk 
 different and they eat different 
 every every few kilometers you will see 
 people are different and we have no 
 problem that's what that's how it would 
 have been yeah only because you 
 protected yourself for too long now race 5843.
 seems to be one big issue right 
 but the money disparity you think is the 
 economic disparity which is difficult to 
 handle yeah right now if you take away 
 the boundaries of this country maybe 
 half the world it will be right here in 
 the united states 
 and that will not be a solution 5861.
 because you will become poor 
 right okay the united states will be 
 poverty ridden 
 if that happens 
 but 
 if you 
 totally wall yourself out 
 then also you will become poor in a 
 different way 
 so this has to be first thing is if your 
 identity is little flexible you will do 
 things judiciously as it's necessary for 5884.
 the situation an appropriate action 
 not our actions are never ever absolute 
 our actions are just about being 
 appropriate to the situations in which 
 we exist yeah 
 if there's some parents watching or 5899.
 listening 
 and they're like wow this is very 
 eye-opening i've never thought of it 
 this way they've always raised their 
 kids a certain way their kids are 
 between this word this is a word that i 
 hear very often in united states we 
 don't hear this in india i was raised 
 this way yeah people say i was raised 
 catholic i was raised jewish i was 
 raised baptist i was raised this way 
 see you don't raise human beings you 
 only raise cattle 
 a human being is a possibility that 
 needs to be nurtured not raised 
 in a particular way so you are raising 
 people in a certain way 
 because you're already committed to 
 something that you think is absolute wow 
 nothing is absolute life is a 
 possibility will you allow your children 
 to explore that possibility or do you 
 want to make them like concrete blocks 
 that they come out in a particular shape 
 raised in a certain way 
 no this is not the way to handle 
 humanity 
 so 
 say these parents are hearing this and 
 they want to nurture 
 their children in a different way yes 
 the first thing they must do is 
 but they've been taught something their 
 whole lives they can do their prayers as 
 they know it but let them know that it's 
 not absolute 
 they can sing their national anthem 
 with pride wonderful 
 let them know it's not absolute 
 let them also teach them a two lines of 
 global anthem 
 if not cosmic anthem one global anthem 
 which includes every life's well-being 
 every child should sing this in every 
 school a global anthem yes we need to 
 make a global anthem everything is a 
 binary choice you're either believing 
 something that takes you where you want 
 to go or something that takes you away 
 from where you want to go you're 
 choosing love or you're choosing the 
 opposite which is fear the only beliefs 
 that make any sense are the beliefs that 
 will take you from where you are to 
 where you want to go so what are the 
 beliefs that successful people believe
