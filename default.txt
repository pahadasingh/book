 foreign 
 to speak in English over the next 21 
 days if you don't know me very well 
 hello I am teacher Pricks and I'm going 
 to help you talk to anyone anywhere 
 anytime in English make sure to oops 
 subscribe to my channel because every 
 week I post different kinds of English 
 lessons to help you become a better and 28.
 more confident English speaker now guys 
 you may be thinking oh but Priscilla in 
 21 days that's ridiculous you're 
 ridiculous ah I'm out I'm out of here 
 okay first and foremost this video is 
 not for beginners 
 No period I'm speaking in English I'm 
 not focusing on real beginners this 
 video is aimed at pre-intermediate and 
 intermediate students basically these 53.
 are the students I help here on my 
 channel pre-intermediate and 
 intermediate students I help these 
 people go from stuck to speaking in six 
 months now guys at this level what is 
 going to happen to many students 
 especially if you study alone and you 
 don't follow a good method you will 
 struggle to speak English because you're 
 in your head you're constantly 
 translating phrases you're trying to 
 make the phrases in your mind in English 
 in Portuguese or in Spanish or in 
 Italian in your native language and then 
 you translate to English this is a very 
 common habit and this is a result of the 
 way you started the journey the way you 
 conditioned your brain when you started 
 learning 
 so now many students come to my channel 
 many people follow me because they want 103.
 to change and I give wonderful 
 recommendations here for you to change 
 your habits because at the end of the 
 day what I'm gonna teach you today and 
 I'm gonna give you two challenges two 
 exercises for you to do 
 well it's a change of habit it's a 
 change of action and if you implement 
 this for the next 21 days you will see 
 changes I'm not saying you're going to 
 be perfect no you will be speaking maybe 
 much better than than now in 21 days we 
 feel you will feel the change and that's 
 all I want for you but are you going to 139.
 stop after 21 days no that's not how it 
 works 
 so 145.
 to improve your speaking you will need 
 to improve your reaction time 
 oftentimes when I ask students in my 
 Academy I ask them a question they're 
 like 
 that's a reaction they react slowly they 
 need to think a lot by practicing your 
 English speaking even alone because all 
 the practices I'm going to give here are 
 alone you're gonna do them alone as you 
 study alone they will help you improve 
 your 
 reaction so that when I ask you a 
 question you give it to me okay and 
 that's practice all right and it's not 
 just speaking we have grammar reading 
 vocabulary listening writing they all 
 help you improve your reaction okay now 
 this is basically what I do with my 
 students in my Academy I have students 
 from all over the world my babies my 
 sardines as I call my students and in 
 all the modules in the academy they have 
 instructions to follow a solo what is 
 solo alone a solo speaking routine 
 and I know they improve are they perfect 
 no nobody is perfect but the more they 
 follow the program consistently the 
 better they get and after they finish 
 the program are they done forever no 
 they will need to keep studying because 
 English is a skill you know speaking is 
 a skill that you must practice if you 
 stop you forget or you don't you you 
 don't remain as good as you used to be 
 okay now 21 days first you're not a 
 beginner okay 
 second speaking does not come naturally 
 to us even me Priscilla fluent teacher 
 does English speaking come naturally to 
 me no I'm constantly working I'm 
 constantly studying doing the work or 
 even my medicine is oh I need to take it 
 by the way 
 instantly working on my English 
 so it doesn't come naturally don't be 
 fooled that when you're Advanced or 
 fluent or matter awesome It comes 
 naturally not at all you have to keep 
 going you have to keep exercising your 
 brain okay so you need to nurture or to 
 feed to nurture the habit of speaking 
 even if you don't have anybody I don't 
 have people to talk to me about the 
 subjects I like 
 have you ever thought about that there 
 are many subjects that I like studying 
 that I don't have anybody to practice 
 with me 
 so does that mean I don't try to improve 
 my speaking about those subjects no I do 
 it on my own okay so I follow the same 
 strategies that I teach so you need to 
 be intentional with the speaking 
 practice and not expect to speak without 
 any effort like oh I'm just gonna speak 
 it's gonna come to me no no you're 
 exercising you're constantly working 
 and to notice change even if it's small 333.
 you need to work for at least 21 days 
 consistently okay our brain responds 
 well to gradual and consistent work 
 so the brain our brain works much better 
 responds well when you give results 
 consistently gradually when you give 
 work to your brain when you challenge 
 your brain 
 consistently slowly and you keep going 
 you give a little every day a little 
 every day and that's how you build up 
 your fluency that's why my Academy in 
 our group on Facebook my students have 
 many challenges for them to keep working 
 on their speaking even alone why because 
 I'm doing this to the brain to their 
 brain so that they can keep having 
 little things for them to do that will 
 boost their English and make them talk 
 because thinking of how to speak alone 
 what what ideas how do you start talking 
 that can be challenging as well that's 
 why I prepared a challenge for you today 
 okay 
 now 
 teacher 21 days there are so many videos 
 talking about 21 days so that's it no 21 
 days is an average okay as a matter of 
 fact there are studies that show that to 
 be very honest our a habit a new action 
 that you wanna you wanna make automatic 
 you know you want to do consistently for 
 your brain to understand that it's part 
 of who you are you need at least six to 
 six days 
 yes not just 21 21 is a good start okay 
 it's a good change it's a good Shake 
 okay shake shake shake 
 so in 21 days your habit is not 
 completely formed which means you will 
 still resist the practice you will still 
 resent you're gonna be like ugh I don't 
 wanna do it I don't like it but it's a 
 start it's good okay it's really good 
 but in six six to six days your brain 
 understand that that is part of you but 
 don't stop you just get a little 
 stronger with being consistent with the 
 practice but you still need to do more 
 you still need to keep going you don't 
 stop okay my my goal is my motto is 
 never stop keep going okay 
 so this is according to research there 478.
 are many studies that show that six to 
 six days is The Sweet Spot based on the 
 research they did to several different 
 groups when forming a habit now that 
 being said an apple a day keeps the 
 doctor away 
 I will explain the Apple okay I will 
 talk about the apple and the English and 
 speaking and the the challenges I'll be 
 giving them to you don't go away I know 
 it'll be worth it it'll be worth your 
 time but you need to understand this 
 part so that it can give you the 
 exercise okay maybe you're new you're 
 watching this you're giving me a chance 
 for the first time you need to watch the 
 entire video to fully understand now 
 this is a proverb that became quite 
 popular 
 okay in the 19th century doctors started 
 advocating for the consumption of apples 
 and healthy food in general if one eats 
 healthy for Foods one will remain in 
 good health and will not need to see the 
 doctor very often so this became a very 
 popular proverb oh what happened away 
 keeps the doctor away of course the 
 doctors were not just referring to the 
 Apple 
 you need to eat more healthy you know 
 good food 
 so that you can stay away from the 
 doctor as much as possible if you know 
 what I'm saying and here I I liked this 
 thing like one a little 
 you don't need to like go crazy with the 
 healthy food but a little every day that 
 is so much better than nothing so you 
 need to think of that to get to a level 
 like I am doing right now speaking no 
 problems you feel like I'm not making an 
 effort well a little every day a little 
 apple every day that will help you build 
 the confidence to talk to anyone 
 anywhere anytime 
 so don't wait for the moment when you 
 finally have someone to practice with 
 time is life 
 don't waste your life waiting for the 
 perfect scenario when you have a teacher 
 a private teacher which in many cases 
 will not really be the solution or when 
 you finally travel or when you finally 
 have a lot of money to spend at a school 
 don't wait for the perfect scenario 
 that's an illusion perfect is today 
 you're alive enjoy okay focus on using 
 what you got and work on simply speaking 
 exercises that will help you level up 
 level up your English and that's what I 
 want to do make sure to subscribe to my 
 channel okay every week I bring 
 different lessons grammar vocabulary 
 listening strategies like this one I 
 have many lessons here more than 700 
 free lessons for you I also have my 
 stapling cycle make sure to check them 
 out 638.
 especially if you need to build better 
 study habits that's basically what I do 
 in my 21 day study plan psycho and why 
 cycle because I wanna I wanna help you 
 keep repeating the cycle I teach you how 
 to repeat this study style so check it 
 out it's in the description of this 
 video now activities you're going to do 
 and I'm going to give you two 
 recommendations two challenges for you 
 to implement including speaking in your 
 practice what is that supposed to mean 
 you study three times a week that's what 
 I do okay I study three sometimes four 
 and when I'm very busy too but I like 
 three three is my sweet spot okay 
 minimum three times a week and what I 
 like the most is four okay sitting down 
 consistently 
 in every practice I speak 
 five minutes ten minutes sometimes I get 
 too excited so I speak a little more 
 but I speak 
 so my practice for example yesterday I 
 was studying 
 prefixes vocabulary it was a vocabulary 
 practice 
 so I created some written examples and 
 then orally without using my my notes I 
 created more examples and then I 
 answered one question I think more 
 questions where I included the words I 
 was studying so you always included 
 speaking in your practice whether it is 
 grammar vocabulary listening writing you 
 include 
 again another thing again no uh not 
 again another Point practice telling 
 stories everybody has stories to share 
 something that happened to you to your 
 cousin to your neighbor to your loved 
 ones practice telling the most memorable 
 stories that you know stories that are 
 special to you I strongly recommend you 
 get started with those and practice 
 describing the story that is going to be 
 very helpful for you okay and you are 
 going to do that orally that's my 
 biggest recommendation and I will talk 
 about the challenges you're going to 
 have the problems you may face doing 
 this exercise stay with me okay 
 answering questions in English daily now 
 the challenge that I'm going to give you 
 is for the next 21 days and I don't 
 recommend you stop because it's very 
 short you're not going to be here for a 
 long time doing this exercise so for 
 this challenge 21 days don't skip a day 
 okay don't skip so you started today 
 with this challenge then tomorrow Friday 
 then Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday 
 Wednesday and so on until you complete 
 the 21 days so that you see the 
 difference what I wanted what I want to 815.
 show you is the power of habits and the 
 power of guidance and I'm gonna give 
 this guidance to you 
 and finally another thing you're going 
 to do orally is describe the news now 
 I'm not a big fan of watching the news I 
 am very picky with the news I watch but 
 I do watch the news to get some 
 information about economy about what is 
 happening in the world so I get some 
 news okay and the ones I get I practice 
 describing them in English 
 I always included speaking in my 
 practice if there is one thing I wanted 
 to remember from this video is always 
 include speaking in my practice this is 
 the number one rule of every fluent 
 English speaker okay 
 now how often as I said to notice 
 results you will need to do this 
 for 21 days 
 at least okay and then six to six would 
 be the 
 sweet spot but do you stop after that no 
 you keep going okay now I will show I 
 prepared 21 questions for you okay they 
 are not so easy questions you can answer 
 them very quickly in one sentence 
 but I don't recommend I recommend to 
 take the time to reflect upon these 
 questions I think this is a problem in 
 society nowadays oh what was the last 
 book you read 
 oh are you Red 
 the power of habits 
 reflect share the experience that's the 
 speaking practice you need to think 
 about okay what can I talk about 
 connected with this book to answer this 
 question what was the last book you read 
 talk about it 
 like explain 
 share 
 and this will work on your critical 
 thinking in English which is something 
 that pre-intermediate and intermediate 
 students don't do they just keep going 
 with the easy questions do you like to 
 study no 
 talk about it okay your critical 
 thinking what is the problem with the 
 studying for you you're an adult 
 so you need to exercise your critical 
 thinking in order to 
 expand your English if you want to go to 
 the next level 
 so usually my questions when I give 
 questions to my students it's one 
 question and then they're like three 
 four questions around it why because I 
 want to exercise your ability to to 
 share your views your opinions your 
 fears your concerns your anxieties in 
 English 
 so I wanted to to take a screenshot 
 right now okay because it's small you 
 cannot read like this right now you 
 can't read so I will I will uh maximize 
 the screen take a screenshot or choose 
 two slides so screenshot and then you're 
 gonna practice for the next one days one 
 question a day okay so the first one 
 take a screenshot right now okay so this 
 is the first 12 these are the first 12 
 questions now I'm gonna go to the next 
 slide you're gonna take a screenshot or 
 a picture with your phone if you're 
 watching on the TV 
 the rest of the remaining questions so 
 21 questions for you to practice your 
 English speaking I have given my 
 students in the academy many challenges 
 like this they have a lot of challenges 
 like this okay so these are 21 questions 
 each day you're going to answer one 
 question okay 
 now you will have some bumps in the road 
 you may have some challenges you may 
 have some problems they are natural 
 we'll talk about them I'll just give one 
 more challenge idea this I didn't 
 prepare for you I only prepare for my 
 babies in the academy but I will give 
 you the idea okay 
 in your practice there there will be 
 days when you're going to study reading 
 when you're going to do reading when 
 you're going to do writing when you're 
 gonna do listening when you're going to 
 do vocabulary but as I said before every 
 practice must have speaking so here's 
 what I Priscilla do it's what I do with 
 my students in my Academy is what I have 
 always been doing to improve my English 
 okay I turn my reading and my listening 
 into speaking and I at this moment I 
 study English duh and Italian you know 
 parallel Italiano Italiano 
 and this is something I do in Italian in 
 English okay 
 I pick different short videos like I 
 really like this guy okay I think his 1122.
 name people call him Monty but his name 
 is Marco Marco montemayo and montemayo 
 yes montemayo and I love watching his 
 videos I use a lot of his videos to 
 study Italian is he a teacher no he's 
 not a teacher he talks about different 
 things okay different subjects 
 okay so I he he gives business ideas 
 personal development ideas he he talks 
 about a variety of subjects he 
 interviews different Italian people or 
 foreigners from other countries people 
 from other countries 
 so every time I sit down to study 
 Italian I pick a different video from 
 him okay sometimes not because I have 
 other listening exercises but I am at 
 least once a week me Priscilla in my 
 study study routine I include you 
 include a video from him and I work on 
 my listening I work on my writing I work 
 on my vocabulary and I end the practice 
 with speaking I talk about what I saw 
 like this video this week I was watching 
 through the Monday three three do Monday 
 and then I watch okay 
 I don't like mixing the languages 
 because I want to continue and I know 
 that I can't do this here 
 and why do I do this to practice using 
 the words I saw 
 to practice remembering the information 
 that I saw to test how much I remember 
 to exercise my memory people are so 
 worried about their memory they're so 
 like oh my vocabulary sucks 
 I always forget the words but they never 
 exercised their memory 
 so this is a combination of listening 
 and memory exercise improving your 
 memory so I strongly recommend you 
 follow this kind of practice with 
 reading okay I read a text what do I 
 remember 
 exercise your memory you will see that 
 you will get better as you keep doing 
 this listening I was watching the 
 history of filmmaking evolution of the 
 cinema okay the evolution of the movie 
 theaters it's such a good video because 
 I was talking about I was studying 
 Priscilla me I was studying about movies 
 and checking the history of movies and 
 watching some and describing some movies 
 that I watched and then I watched this 
 video to complement my study routine and 
 I did the same thing that I did that I 
 do in Italian I copied my routine from 
 Italian you know my Italian routine is a 
 result of my English routine that's how 
 I study that's how I learn 
 so I finished watching this video I 
 study it I worked on vocabulary 
 listening comprehension and then finally 
 speaking 
 and using words that I'm studying in the 
 vocabulary practice that I have been 
 doing since last week 
 a little goes a long way okay so I what 
 is my recommendation the Second 
 Challenge you can do every day for the 
 next 21 days pick 21 different and short 
 videos about different subjects and try 
 this practice okay today short videos 
 three minutes four minutes five minutes 
 nothing too long okay nothing too long 
 so you watch the video 
 you're gonna take notes you're gonna 
 exercise your memory right what do I 
 remember what do I understand that's 
 memory improve your memory by writing 
 more by describing things more 
 finished worked on the words you don't 
 know excellent now you will finish with 1356.
 the grand finale speak 
 oh but I'm alone nobody will correct me 
 I know 
 I know that our limitations in 
 everything we do even if you had the 
 best teacher in the world there would 
 still be limitations we need to learn 
 how to go past the limitations and get 1375.
 the best we can because time is life use 
 the time you have well as much as 
 possible so this is a good exercise not 
 to correct your mistakes but to 
 condition your brain that when it's time 
 to speak bro or says it's time to speak 
 you won't 
 hesitate 
 or feel like or tell people you can't 
 this is a good practice I strongly 
 recommend it okay now come on oh my God 
 this video is too long Common challenges 
 you will not know words it's completely 
 natural okay and when you do this 
 exercise that's when you identify the 
 words you don't know and it's good 
 because you're practicing so it's 
 natural don't be sad 
 if you don't have the habit of speaking 
 alone if you never did this you will see 
 that it'll be hard at the beginning 
 you'll be resistant okay you'll be like 
 oh my God this is too hard 
 don't give up the phrases may be very 
 short your answers may be very short but 
 don't give up repeat the challenge again 
 and again and again okay 
 three you will hesitate you will take 1445.
 breaks you will get distracted you will 
 think in your you will think in your 
 language this will all happen to you it 
 is natural don't feel like oh this is 
 wrong something wrong no no no no this 
 will happen to all of us I sometimes 
 sometimes no I hesitate a lot when I'm 
 practicing my Italian not English 
 English I have to admit it's pretty easy 
 for me but in Italian I still hesitate 
 and I'm like oh okay good I don't know 
 this word so let's check it out it's 
 natural I don't feel like oh I'm bad I 
 suck no I'm human I'm learning let's go 
 okay and you may need inspiration maybe 
 you will see a question from The 
 Challenge that I shared here and you'll 
 be like I don't know 
 so search for inspiration watch a video 
 read something I do this all the time 
 when I need to talk especially in 
 English Okay more in English than in 
 Italian I saw the subject of the week I 
 chose the subject of the week I don't 
 know how to talk about it because I I 
 don't have information so what do I do I 
 search for inspiration I watch something 
 I read something connected with the 
 subject I want to talk about okay now
