 good morning Sraban how are you today
 good morning Mr Joachim I'm doing well
 thank you that's great to hear today
 we're going to learn about phrasal verbs
 have you heard of them
 before I've heard the term but I'm not
 sure what they
 are no worries Sraban phrasal verbs are
 combinations of verbs and one or more
 particles usually prepositions or
 adverbs that create new meanings they
 can be a bit tricky but we'll start with
 some basic ones today we'll focus on
 hand back hand down hand in and hand
 out okay I'm ready to
 learn
 fantastic let's begin with handback when
 you handback something what do you think
 it
 means um maybe it means giving something
 to someone after they gave it to
 you you're absolutely right Sraban when
 you hand back something it means you
 return it to the person who originally
 gave it to you for example if I give you
 a worksheet and then you give it back to
 me you are handing it
 back got it so what about hand
 down great question hand down means
 passing something to someone who is
 usually younger or less experienced than
 you it's like giving something to the
 Next Generation for example if your
 grandmother gives you her old toy she is
 handing it down to
 you that makes sense how about hand
 in hand in is when you submit something
 to a person or place usually a teacher
 or an office for instance when you
 finish your homework and give it to me
 you are handing it in I understand and
 the last one
 handout exactly handout means
 Distributing or giving something to a
 group of people for example when a
 teacher gives worksheets to all the
 students in the class they are handing
 out the
 worksheets I think I've got the hang of
 these phrasal verbs Mr
 Joachim you're doing great Sraban now let's
 practice a bit can you think of a
 sentence using
 handback sure if my friend borrows my
 pen I can hand it back to her when she's
 done using it excellent example now how
 about a sentence with hand
 down my mom handed down her favorite
 book to me because she loved it when she
 was a
 child perfect and now a sentence with
 hand in
 when I finish my drawing I will hand it
 in to my art
 teacher very good Sraban and finally a
 sentence with hand
 out at the end of the party my mom will
 hand out goodie bags to all my
 friends wonderful job Sraban you've
 grasped the basics of these phrasal
 verbs remember phrasal verbs can be
 quite fun once you get the hang of them
 keep practicing and you'll become even
 more fluent in English
 if you have any more questions feel free
 to
 ask thank you Mr Joachim this was really
 helpful I'll make sure to practice these
 phrasal
 verbs you're very welcome Sraban I'm glad
 you found it helpful now let's explore
 some more phrasal verbs related to the
 topic of travel these are book into
 check in check out and drop
 off travel sounds exciting can you
 explain book into
 first of course when you book into a
 hotel or a place to stay it means you
 make a reservation or arrange for a room
 in advance for instance if your family
 is going on vacation your parents might
 book into a hotel before the trip to
 ensure they have a place to
 stay oh I see so what's
 checkin check in is what you do when you
 arrive at a hotel or airport it's the
 process of registering or letting them
 know you've arrived at a hotel you
 provide your name and details to the
 receptionist and at the airport you go
 to the check-in counter to get your
 boarding
 pass thanks for explaining and check
 out when you're ready to leave a hotel
 you check out it involves settling any
 outstanding bills returning your room
 key and officially leaving the place you
 were staying at it's like saying goodbye
 to the
 hotel that makes sense and drop
 off drop off means to leave someone or
 something at a specific location for
 example if your parents are taking you
 to the airport they will drop you off at
 the terminal before you check in for
 your
 flight got it so if my family is going
 on a trip
 my parents would book into a hotel check
 in when we arrive check out when we
 leave and they might drop me off at the
 airport that's exactly right Sraban
 you're really getting the hang of these
 travel related phrasal
 verbs thanks Mr Joachim learning English
 with you is so much
 fun it's my pleasure Sraban learning can
 be enjoyable and it's wonderful to see
 your progress now can you create a

 vacation excellent and how about a

 resort we will check out and head back
 home perfect now let's do checkin can
 you use it in a
 sentence when we arrive at the airport
 we'll check in and get our boarding
 passes great job and finally a sentence
 with drop
 off my aunt will drop me off at the
 train station on her way to work
