Here are 100 interview questions along with their answers regarding RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript), a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences.

### Basic RxJS Concepts
1. **What is RxJS?**
   - RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and functional programming with operators.

2. **What is an Observable?**
   - An observable is a lazy collection of multiple values over time. It can emit zero or more values and can be synchronous or asynchronous.

3. **What are the three types of notifications an observable can emit?**
   - Next, Error, and Complete.

4. **What is the purpose of an Observer in RxJS?**
   - An observer is an object that subscribes to an observable and reacts to values emitted by the observable (next, error, or complete).

5. **What is the difference between a cold and hot observable?**
   - Cold observables produce values only when they are subscribed to, while hot observables produce values regardless of whether there are subscribers.

6. **How do you create an observable in RxJS?**
   - Using the `Observable` constructor or creation operators like `of()`, `from()`, `interval()`, etc.

7. **What is the difference between `of()` and `from()` in RxJS?**
   - `of()` takes multiple arguments and emits them sequentially, whereas `from()` takes an array, promise, or iterable and emits each value.

8. **What is an operator in RxJS?**
   - Operators are pure functions that enable functional programming in RxJS. They allow you to manipulate observable sequences like transforming, filtering, combining, etc.

9. **What are pipeable operators in RxJS?**
   - These are functions that can be chained using the `pipe()` method on an observable. Examples include `map()`, `filter()`, `mergeMap()`, etc.

10. **How do you use an operator in RxJS?**
    - By importing the operator and passing it inside the `pipe()` method of an observable.

161. **What does the `repeatWhen()` operator do in RxJS?**
    - `repeatWhen()` resubscribes to the source observable based on the emissions from another observable, used to control when to repeat the observable.

162. **How does `shareReplay()` differ from `share()`?**
    - `shareReplay()` replays previously emitted values to new subscribers, while `share()` only shares the same observable execution without replaying past emissions.

163. **What does the `maxConcurrent` parameter do in `mergeMap()`?**
    - The `maxConcurrent` parameter limits the number of inner observables that can be active simultaneously, controlling the concurrency of merged observables.

164. **What is `catchError()` used for in RxJS?**
    - `catchError()` handles errors by catching them and returning a new observable or an error-free fallback observable.

165. **How does `takeUntil()` work in RxJS?**
    - `takeUntil()` unsubscribes from the source observable when another observable emits, preventing further emissions from the source.

166. **What is the `publishBehavior()` operator?**
    - `publishBehavior()` is similar to `BehaviorSubject`, but it multicasts the last emitted value or a default value to new subscribers.

167. **How does `mergeScan()` work in RxJS?**
    - `mergeScan()` applies an accumulator function to the source observable, similar to `scan()`, but allows asynchronous inner observables to be merged in sequence.

168. **What is `withLatestFrom()` in RxJS and how is it used?**
    - `withLatestFrom()` combines the source observable with the latest values from other observables, emitting when the source emits.

169. **What is the difference between `retry()` and `retryWhen()`?**
    - `retry()` automatically retries a failed observable, while `retryWhen()` allows you to provide custom logic using another observable to control the retry behavior.

170. **How does the `takeWhile()` operator work?**
    - `takeWhile()` emits values from the source observable as long as a specified condition is true and then completes.

171. **What is the `exhaust()` operator used for?**
    - `exhaust()` subscribes to an inner observable and ignores further emissions from the source observable until the inner observable completes.

172. **What is `timeInterval()` used for in RxJS?**
    - `timeInterval()` tracks the time between consecutive emissions from the source observable and emits both the value and the time interval.

173. **How does the `dematerialize()` operator work?**
    - `dematerialize()` converts `Notification` objects (created by `materialize()`) back into their respective observable events, like emissions, errors, or completions.

174. **How can you implement a countdown timer with RxJS?**
    - Use the `interval()` or `timer()` operators along with `take()` and `map()` to create a countdown.

    ```javascript
    timer(0, 1000).pipe(map(i => countdown - i), take(countdown));
    ```

175. **How can you debounce API requests in a search bar using RxJS?**
    - Use `fromEvent()` on the input field, combine it with `debounceTime()` to delay API calls, and apply `switchMap()` to cancel previous requests.

    ```javascript
    fromEvent(input, 'input').pipe(debounceTime(300), switchMap(searchTerm => searchAPI(searchTerm)));
    ```

176. **What is the difference between `interval()` and `timer()` in RxJS?**
    - `interval()` emits values at a regular interval starting immediately, while `timer()` can start after a specified delay and then emit values periodically.

177. **What is `reduce()` in RxJS, and how does it work?**
    - `reduce()` accumulates values from the source observable using an accumulator function and emits the final accumulated value when the observable completes.

178. **What is the difference between `map()` and `mergeMap()` in RxJS?**
    - `map()` transforms values emitted by the source observable, while `mergeMap()` maps each value to an inner observable and merges the emissions from all inner observables.

179. **What is `delayWhen()` in RxJS?**
    - `delayWhen()` delays the emission of each value from the source observable based on another observable returned by a function.

180. **How does `share()` work in RxJS?**
    - `share()` converts a cold observable into a hot observable, allowing multiple subscribers to share the same execution and prevent multiple subscriptions.

181. **What is the purpose of `first()` in RxJS?**
    - `first()` emits the first value that matches a condition and then completes. It can also emit the first value of the observable if no condition is provided.

182. **What is the purpose of `takeLast()`?**
    - `takeLast()` collects the last `n` values emitted by the source observable and emits them when the observable completes.

183. **How can you handle multiple HTTP requests in parallel with RxJS?**
    - Use `forkJoin()`, `combineLatest()`, or `mergeMap()` to handle multiple HTTP requests and emit combined results when all requests complete.

    ```javascript
    forkJoin([httpCall1$, httpCall2$]).subscribe();
    ```

184. **How does `concatMap()` help in executing sequential HTTP requests?**
    - `concatMap()` ensures that each inner observable (HTTP request) completes before the next one starts, preserving the sequence of requests.

185. **What is the role of `tap()` in RxJS?**
    - `tap()` is used for performing side effects like logging or debugging, without altering the emissions of the observable.

186. **What is the difference between `BehaviorSubject` and `ReplaySubject`?**
    - `BehaviorSubject` emits the most recent value to new subscribers, while `ReplaySubject` emits a specified number of previous values to new subscribers.

187. **What is a `Subject` in RxJS, and how does it differ from an observable?**
    - A `Subject` is both an observable and an observer, meaning it can multicast values to multiple subscribers and also manually emit values using `next()`.

188. **What does `materialize()` do in RxJS?**
    - `materialize()` converts each emission, error, or completion notification into a `Notification` object, useful for debugging or observing the entire lifecycle of an observable.

189. **What is the `delay()` operator in RxJS?**
    - `delay()` postpones the emission of values from the source observable by a specified time duration.

190. **How can you implement error retries in HTTP requests with RxJS?**
    - Use `retry()` or `retryWhen()` to automatically retry failed HTTP requests.

    ```javascript
    httpRequest$.pipe(retry(3)).subscribe();
    ```

191. **What is the purpose of `ignoreElements()`?**
    - `ignoreElements()` suppresses all emitted values from the source observable but lets error or completion notifications pass through.

192. **What does `scan()` do in RxJS?**
    - `scan()` applies an accumulator function to each emitted

 value and outputs the accumulated result as the observable emits.

193. **What is `concatAll()` in RxJS?**
    - `concatAll()` flattens a higher-order observable by subscribing to each inner observable sequentially, ensuring each one completes before moving to the next.

194. **How does `combineLatest()` differ from `forkJoin()`?**
    - `combineLatest()` emits values whenever any of the source observables emit, while `forkJoin()` emits only once, when all observables complete.

195. **What is `skipWhile()` in RxJS?**
    - `skipWhile()` skips values emitted by the source observable as long as a specified condition is true, and then emits all subsequent values.

196. **What does `retryWhen()` do in RxJS?**
    - `retryWhen()` retries a failed observable based on another observable that dictates when to retry.

197. **How can you use RxJS to throttle user actions?**
    - Use `throttleTime()` or `throttle()` to control the rate of events like button clicks or form submissions.

198. **What is `find()` in RxJS, and how does it work?**
    - `find()` emits the first value from the source observable that satisfies a provided condition and completes.

199. **What is `multicast()` used for in RxJS?**
    - `multicast()` shares a single subscription among multiple subscribers using a `Subject` or similar mechanism, avoiding multiple executions of the source observable.

200. **What does `bufferCount()` do in RxJS?**
    - `bufferCount()` collects emitted values into a buffer and emits the buffer when it reaches a specified number of values.
