### Uncontrolled Components in ReactJS

**Uncontrolled components** are components where form data is handled by the DOM itself, rather than being controlled by the React state. Instead of using React’s `state` to manage form inputs, you rely on `ref` to access form values directly from the DOM.

In an uncontrolled component, the form data is handled by the DOM, meaning that the input element maintains its own internal state.

#### Key Features of Uncontrolled Components:
- **Uses `ref`**: Accesses the DOM element directly to get the current value.
- **State managed by the DOM**: React does not control the value of the input; instead, the browser controls the input field value.
- **Simpler setup**: Useful for simple forms or where React state is unnecessary.

### Code Example of Uncontrolled Components

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class UncontrolledForm extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.inputRef = React.createRef(); // Create a ref for the input field
  }

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Access the input field value using the ref
    alert('Form Submitted! Input value: ' + this.inputRef.current.value);
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          {/* Use defaultValue to set an initial value */}
          <input type="text" defaultValue="John Doe" ref={this.inputRef} />
        </label>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default UncontrolledForm;
```

### Explanation:

- **`React.createRef()`**: This creates a reference to the input field, which allows direct access to the DOM element without the need to store the input value in the component’s state.
- **`defaultValue`**: Since the input is uncontrolled, `defaultValue` is used to set the initial value. Unlike `value`, which forces the input to be controlled by React, `defaultValue` sets the starting value without controlling the input.
- **`this.inputRef.current.value`**: This accesses the value of the input field when the form is submitted.

Uncontrolled components are useful when you want simple form handling or when you need to integrate with non-React libraries that expect input values to be handled by the DOM.

### Quiz on Uncontrolled Components

1. **What is the primary difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?**
   - A) Controlled components use the DOM to manage their internal state, while uncontrolled components use React state.
   - B) Controlled components are controlled by React's state, while uncontrolled components are managed by the DOM.
   - C) Controlled components use `useEffect`, while uncontrolled components use `useState`.
   - D) Controlled components are used only for form submissions, while uncontrolled components are not.

2. **In uncontrolled components, which of the following is typically used to access the input value?**
   - A) `onChange`
   - B) `value`
   - C) `ref`
   - D) `useState`

3. **Which of the following props is used in uncontrolled components to set an initial value?**
   - A) `value`
   - B) `defaultValue`
   - C) `onChange`
   - D) `initialValue`

4. **What is the main benefit of using uncontrolled components?**
   - A) Simpler and minimal form handling without React's state management.
   - B) Full control over form input elements.
   - C) React automatically handles form validation.
   - D) Forms cannot be submitted unless input is controlled by React.

5. **How do you get the value of an input field in an uncontrolled component?**
   - A) Through React state
   - B) Using `onChange` handler
   - C) By accessing the `ref` of the input field
   - D) Using `useState` hook

6. **What happens if you use the `value` prop in an uncontrolled component?**
   - A) The input becomes controlled by React state.
   - B) It throws an error because `value` is not allowed in uncontrolled components.
   - C) The input behaves like a controlled component.
   - D) The `value` prop is ignored by the DOM.

### Quiz Answers:
1. B) Controlled components are controlled by React's state, while uncontrolled components are managed by the DOM.
2. C) `ref`
3. B) `defaultValue`
4. A) Simpler and minimal form handling without React's state management.
5. C) By accessing the `ref` of the input field
6. A) The input becomes controlled by React state.

### Conclusion:
Uncontrolled components can be useful in scenarios where you don't need to manage every form input’s value through React state. Instead, you access the input data directly from the DOM using `ref`. However, for more complex forms or when the form data is closely tied to the app's state, controlled components are preferred.
