In Angular, the module system (using `NgModule`) has been the standard way to organize components, directives, pipes, and services. However, the concept of **standalone components** was introduced in Angular 14 to simplify and streamline development. Here's why standalone components are useful, even with the module system in place:

### 1. **Reduced Boilerplate**
   - In the module system, you must declare components inside a module (`NgModule`). This adds extra code and complexity, especially for small apps or libraries. Standalone components eliminate the need for an `NgModule`, reducing the boilerplate by letting you declare components directly without associating them with a module.

### 2. **Simplified Code Structure**
   - With standalone components, you can manage the dependencies directly at the component level. Instead of tracking which module declares a component, you import the required dependencies directly inside the component itself.

### 3. **Modularization Flexibility**
   - Standalone components allow you to develop isolated, self-contained units that donâ€™t rely on a module system for functionality. This can improve reusability and decouple components from the broader structure of the application, making them easier to manage, test, and reuse in different projects or contexts.

### 4. **Better for Micro Frontends**
   - In large, enterprise-level applications or micro-frontend architectures, standalone components make it easier to build isolated features. Each micro-frontend or isolated part of the app can be built without having to worry about global Angular modules or declarations.

### 5. **Tree-Shaking Improvements**
   - Standalone components can lead to more optimized bundling. Since there's no module system that loads unused parts, tree-shaking (removal of unused code) becomes more efficient.

### 6. **Newer Development Paradigm**
   - As Angular evolves, the move towards standalone components reflects a shift towards a simpler and more modern development paradigm. It offers developers a new, more flexible way to structure their applications while still supporting the traditional `NgModule` approach.

In summary, standalone components offer a way to simplify Angular development, reduce dependencies, and improve the modularization of your code, making development faster and more efficient compared to using modules for every component.
