Top 10 Frequently Asked Angular Life Cycle Hooks Interview Questions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

By familiarizing yourself with these Angular lifecycle hooks interview questions, you'll be ready to demonstrate your expertise and impress your interviewer. Gain insight into the role of life cycle hooks in Angular components and directives, learn about their specific use cases, and understand the sequence in which they are called.

### Q1: What are life cycle hooks in Angular and why are they important?

A: Life cycle hooks are special methods in Angular that are called at specific stages in a component or directive's life cycle. They are important because they allow developers to execute custom code at various stages of the component or directive's life cycle, enabling better control over the behavior and state of the application.

### Q2: How does the ngOnInit() hook work, and when is it called?

A: The ngOnInit() hook is a life cycle hook that is called once after the Angular component or directive has been initialized, specifically after the first ngOnChanges() call. It is typically used to initialize component properties, fetch data, or set up event listeners.

### Q3: Explain the ngOnChanges() hook and give an example of its use.

A: The ngOnChanges() hook is a life cycle hook that is called when any data-bound input property changes. It receives an object containing the current and previous property values as arguments. This hook is useful for reacting to input property changes, such as updating the component's state or validating input values.

Example:
```typescript
@Component({ selector: 'app-example', template: `...` }) 
export class ExampleComponent implements OnChanges { 
    @Input() count: number; 
    ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) { 
        if (changes.count) { 
            console.log('Count changed:', changes.count.previousValue, '->', changes.count.currentValue); 
        } 
    } 
}
```

### Q4: What is the purpose of the ngDoCheck() hook, and when should it be used?

A: The ngDoCheck() hook is a life cycle hook called whenever change detection runs. It is used for implementing custom change detection logic, such as checking for changes in objects or arrays not detected by Angular's default change detection mechanism.

### Q5: Describe the ngAfterContentInit() hook and its role in the component life cycle.

A: The ngAfterContentInit() hook is a life cycle hook called once after Angular projects external content into the component's view. It is useful for initializing component properties or logic that depend on the projected content.

### Q6: How does the ngAfterContentChecked() hook work, and when is it called?

A: The ngAfterContentChecked() hook is a life cycle hook called after Angular checks the content projected into the component, as well as the component's view. It is called after each change detection cycle and is useful for reacting to content changes or performing additional checks.

### Q7: Explain the ngAfterViewInit() hook and provide a use case for it.

A: The ngAfterViewInit() hook is a life cycle hook called once after Angular initializes the component's view and child views. It is useful for manipulating DOM elements or interacting with child components after they have been fully rendered.

Use case: Accessing a child component or a DOM element using the ViewChild decorator and performing some action on it.

### Q8: What is the purpose of the ngAfterViewChecked() hook, and when is it triggered?

A: The ngAfterViewChecked() hook is a life cycle hook called after Angular checks the component's view and child views. It is triggered after each change detection cycle, and it is useful for reacting to view changes or performing additional checks.

### Q9: Describe the ngOnDestroy() hook and its importance in the Angular life cycle.

A: The ngOnDestroy() hook is a life cycle hook called just before Angular destroys the component or directive. It is important for cleaning up resources, such as subscriptions or event listeners, to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper application performance.

### Q10: How do life cycle hooks differ between Angular components and directives?

A: While Angular components and directives share some life cycle hooks, there are differences in their life cycle hook sets. Components have a more extensive set of hooks because they have associated views and content projection, while directives do not.

Shared hooks between components and directives:

-   ngOnChanges()
-   ngOnInit()
-   ngDoCheck()
-   ngOnDestroy()

Hooks specific to components:

-   ngAfterContentInit()
-   ngAfterContentChecked()
-   ngAfterViewInit()
-   ngAfterViewChecked()

Importance of Life Cycle Hooks in Angular Applications
------------------------------------------------------

Life cycle hooks play a crucial role in Angular applications as they allow developers to execute code at specific points during a component's life cycle. By utilizing these hooks, developers can control component behavior, optimize performance, and handle resource management more effectively. Life cycle hooks enable developers to:

1.  Initialize components and set default values for properties.
2.  React to changes in input properties, making components more dynamic.
3.  Perform custom change detection, reducing the overhead of Angular's built-in change detection mechanism.
4.  Manipulate the DOM, adding or modifying content as required.
5.  Perform cleanup tasks when components are no longer needed, preventing memory leaks and improving application performance.

Understanding life cycle hooks is essential for developing robust Angular applications and is a crucial skill for any Angular developer, especially during interviews where life cycle questions are common.


Types of Angular Life Cycle Hooks
---------------------------------

There are several Angular life cycle hooks that developers can use to control the behavior and performance of components and directives. Here's a list of the most common life cycle hooks in Angular:

1.  ngOnChanges(): This hook is called when Angular detects changes to input properties of a component or directive. It allows developers to perform custom actions based on changes to specific input properties.
2.  ngOnInit(): This hook is called once after the component or directive is initialized. It is typically used to perform initialization tasks, such as fetching data or setting default values for properties.
3.  ngDoCheck(): This hook is called during every change detection run, after ngOnChanges() and ngOnInit(). Developers can use it to implement custom change detection or update the component based on external factors.
4.  ngAfterContentInit(): This hook is called once after Angular projects external content into the component's view. Developers can use this hook to perform actions related to projected content.
5.  ngAfterContentChecked(): This hook is called after Angular checks the content projected into the component's view. It is executed after ngAfterContentInit() and during each subsequent change detection run.
6.  ngAfterViewInit(): This hook is called once after Angular initializes the component's view and child views. Developers can use this hook to perform actions that depend on the view being fully initialized, such as manipulating the DOM.
7.  ngAfterViewChecked(): This hook is called after Angular checks the component's view and child views. It is executed after ngAfterViewInit() and during each subsequent change detection run.
8.  ngOnDestroy(): This hook is called just before Angular destroys the component or directive. Developers can use this hook to perform cleanup tasks, such as unsubscribing from observables or detaching event listeners.

Each life cycle hook has its specific use cases, and understanding when and how to use them is essential for building efficient, well-structured Angular applications.
