**Top 15 Advanced TypeScript Tricks for 2024**

TypeScript has become the go-to language for building robust, scalable applications, especially in the world of React Native. We can not deny the transformative power of TypeScript in modern software development. With its latest updates, TypeScript offers many advanced features that can significantly enhance your codebase. we found these top 10 advanced TypeScript tricks for 2024, along with real examples from top companies adopting these techniques to solve complex challenges.

**1. Leveraging Type Inference**

Type inference is one of TypeScript’s most powerful features. It allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initial value, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.

When Airbnb adopted React Native with TypeScript, they leveraged type inference to reduce boilerplate code, making their codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. For instance:

TypeScript type inference

**2. Utility Types**

Utility types like `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Omit` can transform existing types to create new ones, enabling more flexible and reusable code.

When working on their mobile apps, companies like Uber use `Partial` to make properties optional in certain contexts, such as updating user profiles:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*7Xo-8GMds1H_k7bneQUYJA.png)

Often while working with server & local data, you need to make some properties optional or required.

Instead of defining hundreds of interfaces with slightly altered versions of the same data. You can do that using `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit` & `Required` types.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
  email: string;
}

type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
type PickUser = Pick<User, "name" | "age">;
type OmitUser = Omit<User, "age">;
type RequiredUser = Required<User>;

// PartialUser is equivalent to:
// interface PartialUser {
//   name?: string;
//   age?: number;
//   email?: string;
// }

// PickUser is equivalent to:
// interface PickUser {
//   name: string;
//   age?: number;
// }

// OmitUser is equivalent to:
// interface OmitUser {
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }

// RequiredUser is equivalent to:
// interface RequiredUser {
//   name: string;
//   age: number;
//   email: string;
// }
```
And of course, you can use intersection to combine them:

type A = B & C;

Where `B` & `C` are any types.

**3. Conditional Types**

Conditional types allow developers to create types based on conditions, making your types more dynamic and powerful.

Netflix, which uses TypeScript in some of its projects, employs conditional types to create utility types that adapt based on input types:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*3IX8x-l4BwFSMuJvpfX-vw.png)


Conditional types allow you to create a new type based on a condition. The syntax is similar to the ternary operator, using the `extends` keyword as a type constraint.
```typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;
```
In this example, we define a conditional type called `NonNullable`, which takes a type `T` and checks if it extends `null` or `undefined`. If it does, the resulting type is `never`, otherwise, it's the original type `T`.

Let's expand the advanced types example to include more usability and outputs.
```typescript
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

type ReadonlyPoint = Readonly<Point>;

const regularPoint: Point = {
  x: 5,
  y: 10
};

const readonlyPoint: ReadonlyPoint = {
  x: 20,
  y: 30
};

regularPoint.x = 15; // This works as 'x' is mutable in the 'Point' interface
console.log(regularPoint); // Output: { x: 15, y: 10 }

// readonlyPoint.x = 25; // Error: Cannot assign to 'x' because it is a read-only property
console.log(readonlyPoint); // Output: { x: 20, y: 30 }

function movePoint(p: Point, dx: number, dy: number): Point {
  return { x: p.x + dx, y: p.y + dy };
}

const movedRegularPoint = movePoint(regularPoint, 3, 4);
console.log(movedRegularPoint); // Output: { x: 18, y: 14 }

// const movedReadonlyPoint = movePoint(readonlyPoint, 3, 4); // Error: Argument of type 'ReadonlyPoint' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Point'
```

In this example, we demonstrate the usage of the `Readonly` mapped type and how it enforces immutability. We create a mutable `Point` object and a read-only `ReadonlyPoint` object. We show that attempting to modify a read-only property results in a compile-time error. We also illustrate that read-only types cannot be used where mutable types are expected, preventing unintended side effects in our code.


**4. Mapped Types**

Mapped types enable you to create new types by transforming properties of existing types, which is particularly useful in large codebases.

Facebook uses mapped types in React Native to enforce consistent types across different components:

TypeScript Mapped Types

**5. Template Literal Types**

Template literal types allow you to create types that are based on string literals, enabling more expressive and precise type definitions.

Companies like Shopify, which use TypeScript extensively, leverage template literal types to enforce consistent naming conventions across their API endpoints:

TypeScript Template Literal types

**6. Exhaustive Checks with Never**

Exhaustive checks ensure that all possible cases in a union type are handled, helping to catch bugs at compile time.

Tesla uses exhaustive checks in their React Native applications to handle different states of the app, ensuring that no case is missed:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*Qj5c-rbOCjbUhgXqP16B-A.png)

TypeScript exhaustive checks with Never

**7. Custom Type Guards**

Custom type guards are functions that allow you to narrow down types based on runtime checks, enhancing type safety.

In their complex workflows, Amazon uses custom type guards to ensure that data conforms to expected types before proceeding with critical operations:

TypeScript Custom Type Guards

**8. Decorators**

Decorators provide a way to add annotations and meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.

In enterprise-level applications, Microsoft employs decorators in their TypeScript projects to add metadata, such as logging, to functions and classes:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*HFcAx7N5detuvxKF5psm1A.png)

Decorators in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows you to add metadata, modify or extend the behavior of classes, methods, properties, and parameters. They are higher-order functions that can be used to observe, modify, or replace class definitions, method definitions, accessor definitions, property definitions, or parameter definitions.

Class Decorators
----------------

Class decorators are applied to the constructor of a class and can be used to modify or extend the class definition.
```
function LogClass(target: Function) {
  console.log(`Class ${target.name} was defined.`);
}

@LogClass
class MyClass {
  constructor() {}
}
```
In this example, we define a class decorator called `LogClass`, which logs the name of the decorated class when it is defined. We then apply the decorator to the `MyClass` class using the `@` syntax.

Method Decorators
-----------------

Method decorators are applied to a method of a class and can be used to modify or extend the method definition.
```
function LogMethod(target: any, key: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  console.log(`Method ${key} was called.`);
}

class MyClass {
  @LogMethod
  myMethod() {
    console.log("Inside myMethod.");
  }
}

const instance = new MyClass();
instance.myMethod();
```
In this example, we define a method decorator called `LogMethod`, which logs the name of the decorated method when it is called. We then apply the decorator to the `myMethod` method of the `MyClass` class using the `@` syntax.

Property Decorators
-------------------

Property decorators are applied to a property of a class and can be used to modify or extend the property definition.
```
function DefaultValue(value: any) {
  return (target: any, key: string) => {
    target[key] = value;
  };
}

class MyClass {
  @DefaultValue(42)
  myProperty: number;
}

const instance = new MyClass();
console.log(instance.myProperty); // Output: 42
```
In this example, we define a property decorator called `DefaultValue`, which sets a default value for the decorated property. We then apply the decorator to the `myProperty` property of the `MyClass` class using the `@` syntax.

Parameter Decorators
--------------------

Parameter decorators are applied to a parameter of a method or constructor and can be used to modify or extend the parameter definition.
```
function LogParameter(target: any, key: string, parameterIndex: number) {
  console.log(`Parameter at index ${parameterIndex} of method ${key} was called.`);
}

class MyClass {
  myMethod(@LogParameter value: number) {
    console.log(`Inside myMethod with value ${value}.`);
  }
}

const instance = new MyClass();
instance.myMethod(5);
```
In this example, we define a parameter decorator called `LogParameter`, which logs the index and name of the decorated parameter when the method is called. We then apply the decorator to the `value` parameter of the `myMethod` method of the `MyClass` class using the `@` syntax.


**9. Advanced Types with Type Composition**

Type composition allows you to create complex types by combining simpler types, making your code more modular and reusable.

Slack uses advanced type composition to handle complex data structures in their messaging app, ensuring that types are consistent across different modules:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*s2yrypeTJZbtkzMZoZ1J8w.png)

TypeScript Type Composition

**10. Ensuring Type Safety with “as const”**
You can make your types immutable by adding as const. This ensures that you don't end up accidentally changing the values.

The `as const` assertion allows you to lock down types to their exact values, preventing unintended changes.

Google uses `as const` in their TypeScript codebases to ensure that configuration objects remain immutable throughout the application lifecycle:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*K7IEJsUm6Iszin5a7KQJkA.png)

TypeScript type safety `as const`

**11. Literal Types**
Often you need specific values for a variable, that's where literal types come in handy.
```typescript
type Status = "idle" | "loading" | "success" | "error";
```
It works for numbers too:
```typescript
type Review = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;

// or better yet:
const reviewMap = {
  terrible: 1,
  average: 2,
  good: 3,
  great: 4,
  incredible: 5,
} as const;

// This will generate the same type as above,
// but it's much more maintainable
type Review = typeof reviewMap[keyof typeof reviewMap];
```

**12. Index Signature**

When you have dynamic keys in an object, you can use an index signature to define its type:
```
enum PaticipationStatus {
  Joined = "JOINED",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Pending = "PENDING",
}

interface ParticipantData {
  [id: string]: PaticipationStatus;
}

const participants: ParticipantData = {
  id1: PaticipationStatus.Joined,
  id2: PaticipationStatus.Left,
  id3: PaticipationStatus.Pending,
  // ...
};
```

**13. Generics**

Generics are a powerful tool to make your code more reusable. It allows you to define a type that will be determined by the use of your function.

In the following example, `T` is a Generic type:
```
const clone = <T>(object: T) => {
  const clonedObject: T = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object));
  return clonedObject;
};

const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: {
    c: 3,
  },
};

const obj2 = clone(obj);
```

Here's a nifty type that makes some properties of an object optional.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*oMxxULv6rIfp3l30yT528w.png)

Pick out some properties K and make them Partial, all the other properties remain required.

"I can't speak generics and this doesn't mean anything to me", you might say --- so let's look at an example. Suppose we have:
```
type Foo = {
    foo: string;
    bar: number;
}
```
We can make the `foo` prop optional like so: `Optional<Foo, "foo">` --- let's have autocomplete tell us what the resulting type looks like:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:790/1*PSezf1vxATlV1sW9Ci_y8w.png)

Well, that doesn't help.

"Can we, like, force the compiler to like, expand the object so we can see all the properties?", I hear you ask. And why yes, we can!

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:569/1*ONKmaF1cTuho7b0UuYHJog.png)

Much better, now we can actually see what `Optional<T,K>` does.

Expand<T>
=========

So what does Expand<T> look like?
```
export type Expand<T> = T extends (...args: infer A) => infer R
  ? (...args: Expand<A>) => Expand<R>
  : T extends infer O
  ? { [K in keyof O]: O[K] }
  : never;
```
It just works™. So there you go, two funky generics for the price of one, for use in your TypeScript projects. :)

**14.String suggestions**

Append `string & {}` to your string unions, and you have a type that allows any string, but autocomplete will also show you some values as suggestions.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:753/1*lMIIJSrcW1BOOFTxU0tkIw.png)

## How does it work?

If you have a type like `type Fruit = "apple" | "pear" | string` , the typescript compiler will simplify the type to just `string` , and no autocomplete suggestions will be given.

The trick is to append a type which we know is equivalent to `string` , but the typescript compiler does not.

## Why is it useful?

Say another department defined a contract containing some`enum` type that changes frequently. You don’t want to deploy a new version of your library every time it changes, but by using `string` instead of the enum, you lose a lot of type information and safety.

This can be a middle ground. People using the library will see a fixed set of values, like an enum, yet can put in other arbitrary values, like a string.


**15. Namespaces**

Namespaces in TypeScript are a way to organize and group related code. They help you avoid naming collisions and promote modularity by encapsulating code that belongs together. Namespaces can contain classes, interfaces, functions, variables, and other namespaces.

Defining Namespaces
-------------------

To define a namespace, use the `namespace` keyword followed by the namespace name. You can then add any related code inside the curly braces.
```
namespace MyNamespace {
  export class MyClass {
    constructor(public value: number) {}

    displayValue() {
      console.log(`The value is: ${this.value}`);
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, we define a namespace called `MyNamespace` and add a class `MyClass` inside it. Notice that we use the `export` keyword to make the class accessible outside the namespace.

Using Namespaces
----------------

To use code from a namespace, you can either use the fully-qualified name or import the code using a namespace import.
```
// Using the fully-qualified name
const instance1 = new MyNamespace.MyClass(5);
instance1.displayValue(); // Output: The value is: 5

// Using a namespace import
import MyClass = MyNamespace.MyClass;

const instance2 = new MyClass(10);
instance2.displayValue(); // Output: The value is: 10
```
In this example, we demonstrate two ways of using the `MyClass` class from the `MyNamespace` namespace. First, we use the fully-qualified name `MyNamespace.MyClass`. Second, we use a namespace import statement to import the `MyClass` class and use it with a shorter name.

Nested Namespaces
-----------------

Namespaces can be nested to create a hierarchy and further organize your code.
```
namespace OuterNamespace {
  export namespace InnerNamespace {
    export class MyClass {
      constructor(public value: number) {}

      displayValue() {
        console.log(`The value is: ${this.value}`);
      }
    }
  }
}

// Using the fully-qualified name
const instance = new OuterNamespace.InnerNamespace.MyClass(15);
instance.displayValue(); // Output: The value is: 15
```
In this example, we define a nested namespace called `InnerNamespace` inside the `OuterNamespace`. We then define a class `MyClass` inside the nested namespace and use it with the fully-qualified name `OuterNamespace.InnerNamespace.MyClass`.

**16. Mixins**

Mixins in TypeScript are a way to compose classes from multiple smaller parts, called mixin classes. They allow you to reuse and share behavior between different classes, promoting modularity and code reusability.

Defining Mixins
---------------

To define a mixin class, create a class that extends a generic type parameter with a constructor signature. This allows the mixin class to be combined with other classes.
```
class TimestampMixin<TBase extends new (...args: any[]) => any>(Base: TBase) {\
  constructor(...args: any[]) {\
    super(...args);\
  }

  getTimestamp() {\
    return new Date();\
  }\
}
```
In this example, we define a mixin class called `TimestampMixin` that adds a `getTimestamp` method, which returns the current date and time. The mixin class extends a generic type parameter `TBase` with a constructor signature to allow it to be combined with other classes.

Using Mixins
------------

To use a mixin class, define a base class and apply the mixin class to it using the `extends` keyword.
```
class MyBaseClass {\
  constructor(public value: number) {}

  displayValue() {\
    console.log(`The value is: ${this.value}`);\
  }\
}

class MyMixedClass extends TimestampMixin(MyBaseClass) {\
  constructor(value: number) {\
    super(value);\
  }\
}
```
In this example, we define a base class called `MyBaseClass` with a `displayValue` method. We then create a new class called `MyMixedClass` that extends the base class and applies the `TimestampMixin` mixin class to it.

Let's demonstrate how the mixin class works in practice.
```
const instance = new MyMixedClass(42);\
instance.displayValue(); // Output: The value is: 42\
const timestamp = instance.getTimestamp();\
console.log(`The timestamp is: ${timestamp}`); // Output: The timestamp is: [current date and time]
```
In this example, we create an instance of the `MyMixedClass` class, which includes both the `displayValue` method from the `MyBaseClass` and the `getTimestamp` method from the `TimestampMixin` mixin class. We then call both methods and display their outputs.

## **Conclusion**

Mastering these advanced TypeScript tricks will significantly enhance your ability to build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications in 2024. Companies like Airbnb, Uber, Netflix, and Facebook have already demonstrated how leveraging these techniques can overcome challenges in large-scale projects.
------------------

**More 12 TypeScript tricks for Clean Code**


**1 --- Use Type Annotations:** TypeScript is a statically-typed language, meaning that it allows you to define types for variables and functions. Using type annotations can help catch errors early in the development process and improve code readability.

Here are some examples of type annotations in TypeScript:
```typescript
// Explicitly specify the data type of a variable
let count: number = 0;

// Explicitly specify the data type of a function parameter and return value
function addNumbers(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

// Explicitly specify the data type of a class property
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  getDetails(): string {
    return `${this.name} is ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}
```
In these examples, we use type annotations to specify the data type of a variable, function parameter, function return value, and class property. The type annotations are written after the variable, parameter, or property name, separated by a colon (:), followed by the desired data type.

**2 --- Use Enums:** Enums are a powerful feature of TypeScript that allows you to define a set of named constants. They can help make your code more readable and maintainable, as well as reduce the likelihood of errors caused by magic numbers.

Here's an example of how enums can be used in TypeScript:
```typescript
enum Color {
  Red = "RED",
  Green = "GREEN",
  Blue = "BLUE"
}

function printColor(color: Color): void {
  console.log(`The color is ${color}`);
}

printColor(Color.Red); // output: The color is RED
```
In this example, we define an enum called `Color` that contains three named constants: `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`. Each constant has an associated value, which can be a string or a number. We then define a function called `printColor` that takes a `Color` parameter and logs a message to the console using the parameter value.

When we call the `printColor` function with the `Color.Red` constant as the parameter, it logs the message "The color is RED" to the console.

**3 --- Use Optional Chaining:** Optional chaining is a TypeScript feature that allows you to safely access nested properties and methods without worrying about whether the intermediate values are null or undefined. This can help reduce the likelihood of runtime errors and make your code more robust.

Here's an example of how optional chaining can be used in TypeScript:
```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  address?: {
    street: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;
  };
}

const person1: Person = {
  name: "John",
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA",
  },
};

const person2: Person = {
  name: "Jane",
};

console.log(person1?.address?.city); // output: Anytown
console.log(person2?.address?.city); // output: undefined
```
In this example, we have an interface called `Person` that defines an optional `address` property, which is an object with `street`, `city`, and `state` properties. We then create two objects of type `Person`, one with an `address` property and one without.

We use optional chaining to safely access the `city` property of the `address` object, even if the `address` property or any of its sub-properties are undefined or null. If any of the properties in the chain are undefined or null, the expression will return undefined instead of throwing a TypeError.

**4 --- Use Nullish Coalescing:** Nullish coalescing is another TypeScript feature that can help make your code more robust. It allows you to provide a default value for a variable or expression when it is null or undefined, without relying on falsy values.

Here's an example of how nullish coalescing can be used in TypeScript:
```typescript
let value1: string | null = null;
let value2: string | undefined = undefined;
let value3: string | null | undefined = "hello";

console.log(value1 ?? "default value"); // output: "default value"
console.log(value2 ?? "default value"); // output: "default value"
console.log(value3 ?? "default value"); // output: "hello"
```
In this example, we have three variables that may contain null or undefined values. We use the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to check if the values are nullish (either null or undefined) and provide a default value in that case.

In the first two cases, the variables `value1` and `value2` are null or undefined, respectively, so the default value is returned. In the third case, the variable `value3` contains a non-null/non-undefined value, so that value is returned instead of the default value.

**5 --- Use Generics:** Generics are a powerful feature of TypeScript that allows you to write reusable code that works with different types. They can help reduce code duplication and improve code maintainability.

Here's an example of how generics can be used in TypeScript:
```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let output1 = identity<string>("hello"); // output: "hello"
let output2 = identity<number>(42); // output: 42
```
In this example, we define a function called `identity` that takes a type parameter `T` and returns the same type of value that was passed in. The function can work with any type of data, and the actual data type is specified when the function is called.

We then call the `identity` function with two different data types: a string and a number. The function returns the same type of value that was passed in, so `output1` is of type `string` and `output2` is of type `number`.

**6 --- Use Interfaces:** Interfaces are another powerful feature of TypeScript that can help you write clean and readable code. They allow you to define a contract for a class, object, or function, which can help you avoid common errors and make your code more self-documenting.

Here's an example of how interfaces can be used in TypeScript:
```typescript
interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age?: number;
}

function sayHello(person: Person): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}!`);
  if (person.age) {
    console.log(`You are ${person.age} years old.`);
  }
}

let person1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 30 };
let person2 = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" };

sayHello(person1); // output: "Hello, John Doe! You are 30 years old."
sayHello(person2); // output: "Hello, Jane Doe!"
```
In this example, we define an interface called `Person` that specifies the shape of a person object, including a `firstName` and `lastName` property and an optional `age` property. We then define a function called `sayHello` that takes a `Person` object as an argument and prints a greeting to the console.

We create two objects that match the shape of the `Person` interface, and pass them into the `sayHello` function. The function is able to access the `firstName` and `lastName` properties of each object, and also check whether the `age` property exists before printing it to the console.

**7 --- Use Destructuring:** Destructuring is a shorthand syntax that allows you to extract values from arrays and objects. It can help make your code more readable and concise, as well as reduce the likelihood of errors caused by misaligning variable names.

Here are some examples of how destructuring can be used in TypeScript:

Object destructuring:
```typescript
let person = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 30 };

let { firstName, lastName } = person;

console.log(firstName); // output: "John"
console.log(lastName); // output: "Doe"
```
In this example, we create an object called `person` with three properties. We then use object destructuring to extract the `firstName` and `lastName` properties and assign them to variables of the same name. This allows us to access these properties more easily and with less code.

Array destructuring:
```typescript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let [first, second, , fourth] = numbers;

console.log(first); // output: 1
console.log(second); // output: 2
console.log(fourth); // output: 4
```
In this example, we create an array of numbers and use array destructuring to extract the first, second, and fourth elements and assign them to variables. We skip the third element using an empty slot in the destructuring pattern. This allows us to access specific elements of an array more easily and with less code.

Destructuring can also be used with function parameters, allowing you to extract specific values from an object passed as an argument:
```typescript
function greet({ firstName, lastName }: { firstName: string, lastName: string }): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);
}

let person = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 30 };

greet(person); // output: "Hello, John Doe!"
```
In this example, we define a function called `greet` that takes an object with `firstName` and `lastName` properties as an argument using destructuring syntax in the function parameter. We then pass in a `person` object and the `greet` function is able to extract the `firstName` and `lastName` properties and use them in the console log statement.

**8 --- Use Async/Await:** Async/await is a powerful feature of TypeScript that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code. It can help improve code readability and reduce the likelihood of errors caused by callback hell.

Here is an example of how async/await can be used in TypeScript:
```typescript
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

getData().then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```
In this example, we define an `async` function called `getData` that makes a `fetch` request to an API and waits for the response using the `await` keyword. We then parse the response using the `json()` method and again wait for the result using `await`. Finally, we return the `data` object.

We then call the `getData()` function and use the `then()` method to handle the returned data, or the `catch()` method to handle any errors that may occur.

**9 --- Use Functional Programming Techniques:** Functional programming techniques, such as immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions, can help you write clean and maintainable code. They can help reduce side effects and make your code more predictable and testable.

Pure functions: A pure function is a function that has no side effects and always returns the same output given the same input. Pure functions make it easier to reason about code and can help prevent bugs. Here's an example of a pure function:
```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

Higher-order functions: A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions can be used to create reusable code and simplify complex logic. Here's an example of a higher-order function:

function map<T, U>(arr: T[], fn: (arg: T) => U): U[] {
  const result = [];
  for (const item of arr) {
    result.push(fn(item));
  }
  return result;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = map(numbers, (n) => n * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
In this example, the `map` function takes an array and a function as arguments, and applies the function to each element in the array, returning a new array with the results.

Immutable data: Immutable data is data that cannot be changed after it is created. In functional programming, immutability is emphasized to prevent side effects and make code easier to reason about. Here's an example of using immutable data:
```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newNumbers = [...numbers, 6];
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(newNumbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
In this example, we use the spread operator to create a new array with a new element appended to the end, without modifying the original array.

**10 --- Use Pick Helper:** The Pick helper is a TypeScript utility type that allows us to create new types from existing types, making it easier to reuse and maintain code. It also helps to prevent errors by ensuring that the new type only includes the properties we intend to use.

Here's an example:
```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
  isAdmin: boolean;
}

type UserSummary = Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'>;

const user: User = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'johndoe@example.com',
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: false,
};

const summary: UserSummary = {
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email,
};

console.log(summary); // Output: { name: 'John Doe', email: 'johndoe@example.com' }
```
In this example, we define an interface `User` with several properties. We then define a new type `UserSummary` using the `Pick` utility type, which selects only the `name` and `email` properties from the `User` interface.

We then create an object `user` with all the properties of the `User` interface, and use the `name` and `email` properties to create a new object `summary` of type `UserSummary`.

**11 --- Use Omit Helper:** The Omit helper is a TypeScript utility type that allows us to create new types from existing types, while ensuring that certain properties are excluded. This can be helpful when working with complex interfaces where certain properties may not be needed in certain situations. It can also help prevent errors by ensuring that certain properties are not accidentally included.

Here's an example:
```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
  isAdmin: boolean;
}

type UserWithoutEmail = Omit<User, 'email'>;

const user: User = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'johndoe@example.com',
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: false,
};

const userWithoutEmail: UserWithoutEmail = {
  name: user.name,
  age: user.age,
  isAdmin: user.isAdmin,
};

console.log(userWithoutEmail); // Output: { name: 'John Doe', age: 30, isAdmin: false }
```
In this example, we define an interface `User` with several properties. We then define a new type `UserWithoutEmail` using the `Omit` utility type, which omits the `email` property from the `User` interface.

We then create an object `user` with all the properties of the `User` interface, and use the `name`, `age`, and `isAdmin` properties to create a new object `userWithoutEmail` of type `UserWithoutEmail`.

**12 --- Use Discriminated Unions:** Discriminated unions are a TypeScript feature that allows us to model types that can take on different shapes based on a specific property or combination of properties, and handle them in a type-safe manner using switch statements. It is a powerful feature of TypeScript that can make your code more expressive and maintainable.

Here's an example:
```typescript
interface Square {
  kind: 'square';
  size: number;
}

interface Circle {
  kind: 'circle';
  radius: number;
}

interface Triangle {
  kind: 'triangle';
  base: number;
  height: number;
}

type Shape = Square | Circle | Triangle;

function area(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case 'square':
      return shape.size * shape.size;
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * shape.radius * shape.radius;
    case 'triangle':
      return 0.5 * shape.base * shape.height;
  }
}

const square: Square = { kind: 'square', size: 10 };
const circle: Circle = { kind: 'circle', radius: 5 };
const triangle: Triangle = { kind: 'triangle', base: 10, height: 8 };

console.log(area(square)); // Output: 100
console.log(area(circle)); // Output: 78.53981633974483
console.log(area(triangle)); // Output: 40
```
In this example, we define three interfaces `Square`, `Circle`, and `Triangle`, each representing a different shape. We then define a union type `Shape` that can be either a `Square`, a `Circle`, or a `Triangle`.

We define a function `area` that takes a shape of type `Shape` as an argument and uses a switch statement to calculate the area of the shape based on its kind. The `kind` property is used as the discriminating property, as it uniquely identifies each type of shape.

We then create three objects, one for each type of shape, and call the `area` function with each object as an argument to calculate the area.

In conclusion, these TypeScript tricks for writing clean code can help you write more expressive, maintainable, and error-free code. By using type annotations, enums, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, generics, interfaces, destructuring, async/await, functional programming techniques, and various helper types like `Pick`, `Omit`, and discriminated unions, you can create more robust and scalable TypeScript applications.

These tricks can also help you catch errors early, improve the readability of your code, and reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.
