Using Closure

Closure is a feature in PHP that makes anonymous functions more powerful and flexible.

Anonymous functions are functions that can be assigned to a variable, given as arguments to other functions, and defined dynamically. The Closure class scopes such anonymous functions.

### 2\. Optimizing Memory Usage with Generators

Generators

Generator functions are great for optimizing memory usage when working with large data sets. Such functions are programmed to generate data according to the need step by step, hence all the data.

### 3\. Simplifying Complex Arrays with array_reduce

Using Intl

The intl extension is useful when developing multilingual applications. Especially classes such as NumberFormatter, MessageFormatter, and Locale are noteworthy.

Stream Functions

Stream functions such as fopen, fread, fwrite are important to use memory effectively when working with large files. fopen opens the file, fread reads it and fwrite lets editing file.
