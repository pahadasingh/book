### 1\. What is MySQL and How does it differ from other relational databases?

MySQL is an **open-source** relational database management system (**RDBMS**) that is widely used for **managing structured data**. It utilizes SQL (Structured Query Language) for **querying** and **managing data**. MySQL is known for its reliability, scalability, and performance, making it a popular choice for various applications

### 2\. How to create a database in MySQL?

To create a database in MySQL, we can use the **CREATE DATABASE** statement followed by the name we want to give to our database. For example:

CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;

### 3\. Difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types.

-   **CHAR: **Fixed-length character data type where the storage size is predefined. Trailing spaces are padded to reach the defined length.
-   **VARCHAR:** Variable-length character data type where the storage size depends on the actual data length. No padding of spaces is done.

### 4\. Explain the differences between SQL and MySQL?

| SQL | MySQL |
| --- | --- |
| It is a structured query language that manages the relational database management system. | It is a relational database management system that uses SQL. |
| It is not an open-source language. | MySQL is an open-source platform. It allows access to anyone. |
| SQL supports [XML](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xml-basics) and user defined functions. | It doesn’t support XML and any user defined functions |
| SQL can be implemented in various RDBMS such as PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and others. | MySQL is a specific implementation of an RDBMS that uses SQL for querying and managing databases. |
| SQL itself is not a product and doesn’t have a license. It’s a standard language. | MySQL is open-source and available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). |

### 45\. What are Access Control Lists?

A list of permissions known as an [Access Control List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-lists-acl) is connected to an object. It is MySQL server security model helps in troubleshooting issues like users being unable to connect. MySQL holds the ACL's cached in memory. ACL's also called grant tables.

### **46\. What is Normalization and list the different types of normalization?**

[**Normalization**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-database-normalization) is used to avoid duplication and redundancy. it is a process of organizing data. There are many normal forms of normalization. which are also called successive levels. The first three regular forms are sufficient.

-   **First Normal Form (1NF):** There are no repeating groups within rows.
-   **Second Normal form(2NF):** Value of every supporting column depending on the whole primary key.
-   **Third Normal Form(3NF): **It depends only on the *primary key* and no other value of non-key column.

-   The SQL Server Management Studio is available for use. we can use this to browse to the table where the index will be created, and then right-click on the Indexes node. We must select the New Index option over here.
-   We can identify the index indirectly by specifying the [PRIMARY KEY](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-primary-key-and-unique-key) and the [UNIQUE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/postgresql-unique-index) constraint in the [CREATE TABLE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-sqlite-create-table) or [ALTER TABLE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-alter-add-drop-modify) statement.

### 48\. What are a clustered index and a non clustered index?

**Cluster Index:** An index type used to arrange data in a table is called a [clustered index](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clustering-indexing-in-databases). The table's data are stored in a specific order based on the clustered index.

**Non Cluster Index:** A [non-clustered index](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-queries-on-clustered-and-non-clustered-indexes) is also a type of index used to organize data in a table. The table's data are not stored in a specific order based on the non clustered index.

For more details, Check our latest article on [Difference between Clustered and Non-clustered index](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-clustered-and-non-clustered-index).

### 49\. How to** validate emails using a single query?**

We can use the [regular expressions function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regular-expressions-in-c) (REGEXP_LIKE) to validate emails. Below is the example of validate emails using a single query.

> **SELECT**
>
> Email
>
> **FROM**
>

>
> **where** NOT REGEXP_LIKE(Email, '[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+.[A-Z]{2,4}', 'i');

For detail you can check our latest article on [Regular expressions (Regexp)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mysql-regular-expressions-regexp).

### 50\. **How can you handle the --secure-file-**priv** in MySQL?**

The MySQL Server is restricted from loading directories using the [LOAD DATA INFILE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-import-timestamp-from-a-csv-file-in-mysql) command by the -secure-file-priv option. Use the SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv" command to view the directory that has been configured.

There are two options to handle as below.

-   Either transfer your file to the directory that secure-file-priv specifies.
-   Or you can turn off secure-file-priv. This must be removed at the beginning and cannot be disabled later.
